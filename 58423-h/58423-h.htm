<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1.1em;'>PILLOWS AND PITCHERS</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>‟I</span>S there any way to pack pillows in
pitchers?” said Marjorie, framing
herself in the front doorway, one hand
grasping recklessly the handles of three
large pitchers, and both arms full of sofa-pillows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The group on the veranda looked up
at her doubtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said brilliant Nan. “Have your
pitchers bigger than your pillows, and the
thing is done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the pillows are bigger than the
pitchers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then pack the pitchers in the pillows,”
said Betty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course! Betty, you’re a
genius!” And Marjorie disappeared with
her burdens, while the girls on the veranda
fell to chattering again like half a
dozen shirt-waisted magpies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I know that a story with eight
heroines is an imposition upon even the
gentlest of readers; but you see there
were eight girls in the Blue Ribbon
Cooking Club; and when their president,
Marjorie Bond, proposed that they go
down to Long Beach and spend a fortnight
all by themselves in her father’s
cottage, the whole club rose up as one
girl and voted aye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Objections were disposed of as fast
as they were raised. Permission? The
girls were sure that the sixteen parents
concerned could be persuaded to see the
matter in a favorable light. Expense?
That should be divided equally among
them all. Trouble? Would be more
than compensated by the fun. Luggage?
Not so very much required; the house
was completely furnished, except with
linen and silver, and each girl should
take her share. Burglars? That idea
caused some apprehension; but when Marjorie
said that Uncle Ned and Aunt
Molly would be right next door, plans
were suggested sufficient to scare any
reasonably cautious burglar out of his
wits. And so the preliminaries had been
arranged, and the date decided upon, and
the day had come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Thursday morning, and they
were to leave on the noon train; and now,
although ten o’clock had struck, six sailor-hatted
girls were gathered on the Bonds’
veranda, hurriedly making final arrangements
and frantically trying to remember
what were the most important things they
had forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s like a fire,” Jessie Carroll was
saying; “you know people always save
their old trash and leave their best things
to burn up. Now I’m sure I’ve packed
just the very things we won’t want and
left at home the things we’ll need most.
And that reminds me—Nan, can’t I put
my best hat in your box? I just <span class='it'>had</span> to
take my down comfortable, and it was so
puffy it wouldn’t leave room for anything
else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t take your best hat,” cried
Betty Miller; “we’re not going down to
Long Beach to dress up and be giddy.
It’s so late in the season none of the
summer boarders will be there, and we’re
just going to wear flannel frocks all day,
and tramp in the woods and loll in the
hammocks and get brown as berries and
hungry as hunters and uncivilized as—as
Hottentots.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Betty; but remember somebody
has to cook for these hungry Hottentots,”
said Mrs. Bond, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you afraid, girls, that you’ll
get tired of cooking? And you’ll find
that there’s a great deal of work connected
with housekeeping if you do it all
yourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, indeed, Mrs. Bond,” said Nan
Kellogg. “I just love to cook, and I
don’t mind housework a bit. Mamma
thinks it will be good training for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such doings!” exclaimed Grandma
Bond, a lovely old lady of the silver-haired,
apple-cheeked variety. “Living
on chafing-dish foolery for two weeks!
You’ll all be ill or starved to death in
three days, and you’ll wish yourselves
back in your comfortable homes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not we, grandma!” cried Betty.
“We have a gas-stove and a range besides
our beloved chafing-dish, and we
won’t starve. But if Nan makes our
Welsh rarebits I’ll not promise that we
won’t be ill. Her concoctions are the
stuff that dreams are made on. Oh,
here’s Helen. What’s your misfortune,
my pretty maid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen Morris came up on the veranda
and dropped into a big wicker chair and
fanned herself with her hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girls, I’m exhausted! You know I
said I’d take all the things for afternoon
tea, but I had no idea there were so
many. Why, I’ve packed a whole barrel
and they’re not all in yet. To be
sure, it’s mostly tissue-paper and excelsior;
but I was so afraid they’d break.
And I couldn’t get the tea-cozy in at
all, or the Dresden cups; I’d hate to
break <span class='it'>them</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Betty, sympathetically;
“<span class='it'>don’t</span> break the tea-cozy, whatever you
do, if it’s that pretty yellow satin one.
But you’ve no ingenuity, Nell; why
don’t you wear it down on your head?
Then you’ll look like a drum-major.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will if you’ll all obey my orders.
Well, this won’t do for me. I must go
back and reason with those tea-things.
I just ran over a minute because I saw
you all here. If I can’t get them into
the barrel I’ll have to take a cask besides.
Good-by. I’ll meet you at the train.
What time do we start?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twelve-ten,” replied Hester Laverack.
“I’ll go home with you, Helen,
and help you pack your china.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, do,” said Betty; “two heads are
better than one in any barrel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the two heads were already bobbing
down the walk, and didn’t hear
Betty’s parting shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nell’s crazy,” remarked Millicent
Payne, who always did everything leisurely,
yet always had it done on time.
“I do hope her barrel will go safely, for
her tea-cups and things are lovely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we have tea <span class='it'>every</span> afternoon?”
asked Marguerite Alden, a fragile wisp of
a girl who looked as if a real strong ocean
breeze would blow her away. “I’m so
glad! I don’t care for the tea at all, but
the having it with all us girls together
will be such fun, only—I do hate to wash
up the tea-things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girlies,” said Mrs. Bond, “I think it
would be much better all round if you’d
hire a neat little maid to wash your dishes
for you. You can probably find one down
there, and I’m sure you’ll be glad to have
help when you discover what dish-washing
for eight means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it would be heaps better, Mrs.
Bond,” said Marguerite. “I don’t see
how we can have any fun if we have to
work all the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lazy Daisy!” said Betty. “You
won’t do any more than your share. But
we won’t let the interloper do any of our
cooking; I insist on that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Betty,” said Marguerite, or
Daisy, as the girls called her, though she
wished they wouldn’t; “and you may be
chief cook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Betty, “I’m not chief
cook—Marjorie is that. I’ll be the first
assistant. I’ll prepare the vegetables for
her, and be a—a peeler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurrah for Betty the Peeler!” said
Marjorie, appearing again in the front
door. “And what am I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re the cook,” said Millicent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we’re all cooks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know; but you’re head cook,
chief cook—cook plenipotentiary, or any
title you prefer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll be cook,” said Marjorie,
“just plain cook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, you’ll be more than a plain
cook,” said her mother, laughing, “if you
attempt all the fancy dishes in all those
recipe-books I saw you stowing away in
your trunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they weren’t all recipe-books.
Some of them were delectable tales to be
read aloud at the twilight hour. I could
only take light literature, as the box
weighs about a ton now. So I was
forced to leave out ‘Advice to Young
Maidens’ and Carlyle’s ‘French Revolution,’
for I really hadn’t room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you took ‘Rollo Learning to
Work,’ for I’m sure we’ll need it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Betty, I didn’t; but I packed
‘First Aid to the Injured’ and ‘Alice in
Wonderland’; we can struggle along
with those.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a circulating library down at
Long Beach,” said Nan Kellogg; “we
can get books there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now look here, my rising young authoress,”
said Betty; “you’re not going
down there to read all the time, or write,
either. So you may as well make up your
mind to it, milady, first as last. We’ll
have no bookworms or blue-stockings.
‘Cooks, not Books,’ is our motto. Now,
Duchess, look over your lists for the last
time; I’m going home to lock my trunk,
and then I’m going to don my war-paint
and feathers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am, too,” said Nan; “and I want to
go down to the station an hour before
train-time, so as to have ample leisure to
come back for what I forget.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good idea,” said Marjorie, approvingly.
The girls called her “Duchess”
because she had a high-and-mighty way
of giving orders. Not an unpleasant
way—oh, dear, no! Marjorie Bond was
the favorite of the whole village of Middleton.
Her stately air was due to the fact
that she was rather tall for her sixteen
years, and carried herself as straight as an
arrow. She could have posed admirably
for a picture of Pocahontas. Her dark,
bright eyes were always dancing, and her
saucy gipsy face was always smiling; for
Marjorie had a talent for enjoyment,
which she cultivated at every opportunity.
The girls said she could get fun out of
anything, from a scolding to a jug of sour
cream. And that latter fact suggests Marjorie’s
pet accomplishment, which, though
prosaic, afforded much pleasure to herself
and her friends. She was a born
cook, and by experiment and experience
had become a proficient one. Two years
ago she had proposed the Cooking Club,
and though not very enthusiastic at first,
every one of the eight members would
tell you now that nothing in Middleton
was ever quite so much fun as the Cooking
Club.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure I’ve thought of everything,”
said the Duchess, wrinkling her pretty
brows over a handful of scribbled lists.
“You’re to bring the forks, Nannie, and
a pair of blankets and a table-cloth, and
don’t forget your napkin-ring, and your
jolly Vienna coffee-pot; and, Betty, take
your chafing-dish—we’ll need two; Millicent,
you’re responsible for the spoons,
and Jessie, knives. Lazy Daisy will take
a hammock, and I’ll take one, too; and
I’ve packed lots of sofa-pillows, and I
hope Helen will take her banjo. I’ve
lost my most important list, so I may have
forgotten something. But I’ve packed
towels, hand and dish, and a scrub-brush
and a tack-hammer—and isn’t that all we
need to keep house?—except this good-for-nothing
little bundle, my own, my
only Timmy Loo. Will you go with us,
honey?” Marjorie picked up the bundle
in question, who wagged his absurd
moppy, silvery ears and his still more
absurd moppy, silvery tail, and accepted
the invitation with a few staccato barks
of joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That means yes, of course,” said
Betty; “his French accent is so perfect,
even I can understand it. Well, good-by,
Timmy; I’ll see you later. Can you take
him on the train, Marjorie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; he’ll have to ride in the baggage-car.
But I’ve explained it all to him, and
he doesn’t mind; and he’ll keep an eye
on our trunks and wheels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timmy Loo barked again and blinked
his eyes acquiescently, and Betty gave
him a final pat on his funny little nose
and ran away home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must go, too,” said Marguerite, rising
as she spoke and picking a full-blown
rose from the trellis above her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A careless observer probably would
have called Marguerite the prettiest of all
the Cooking Club girls. She was small,
slender, and graceful, with a rose-leaf
complexion and sea-blue eyes, and a glory
of golden hair that the girls called her
halo. She was visionary and romantic,
and her special chum was Nan Kellogg,
who was lounging in the hammock with
her hands clasped behind her head and
her eyes closed. Nan was a dark-haired,
olive-skinned Southern girl, with a poetic
temperament and a secret ambition to
write verse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, girl,” said Marguerite, dropping
rose-petals, one by one, on Nan’s
nose. “What are you dreaming of?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Nan, opening her eyes, “I
was thinking what gay old times we’re
going to have down there. I’m <span class='it'>so</span> glad
we’re going! Marjorie, you’re <span class='it'>such</span> a
darling, I shall dedicate my first book of
poems to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do,” said Marjorie; “but don’t write
them while we’re down at Long Beach.
What shall we do if you go off on a
poetic flight when it’s your turn to boil
the potatoes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I sha’n’t boil potatoes; they’re
too prosaic. Omelet soufflé is the very
plainest thing I shall ever cook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grandma Bond groaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Margy,” she said despairingly, “I
<span class='it'>hope</span> you packed the medicine-chest I
gave you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, grandma; and your bundle
of old linen and salve for burns, and your
arnica-flowers for bruises, and your sticking-plaster
for cuts, and your toothache
drops, and your Balsam Balm. Oh, the
hospital department will give you a vote
of thanks, engrossed and framed. Now
go on home, Nan and Daisy; I know
you’ll miss the train.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we must go. Good-by, grandma.”
For all the girls insisted on sharing Marjorie’s
grandma, and the dear old lady’s
heart was big enough for them all.
“Good-by, grandma; give us a parting
word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grandma’s eyes twinkled as she replied:
“Well, I advise you to remember
that too many broths spoil the cook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six merry laughs greeted this speech,
and Nan replied: “Indeed they do, and I
won’t allow more than three kinds of soup
at any one meal. Now I’m off, Marjorie;
I’ll meet you at the train—and oh,
Duchess, I ’most forgot to ask you.
Brother Jack says, can he and Ted come
down and spend a day with us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed!” cried Marjorie. “We
are not going to allow a boy in sight all
the time we are there. Tell them we’re
sorry to refuse, but we’re not running a
co-educational institution, and only girls
need apply.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did tell him that, but he begged me
to ask you again—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Marjorie, laughing but positive;
“tell him we turn a deaf ear—I
mean sixteen deaf ears—to his entreaties,
and harden our eight hearts to his appeal.
There is no use, girls; if the boys come
down they’ll spoil everything; don’t you
think so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said each girl, but with such
varying accents that Mrs. Bond laughed
heartily, while Marguerite shook her yellow
curls and protested that she didn’t
want the boys anyway, even if they <span class='it'>did</span>
bring candy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she and Nan went home, and
Jessie Carroll said: “We’ll have plenty
of candy, Marjorie, for father will send
it down whenever I want him to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jessie, that will be fine! It will
be just like boarding-school when the
boxes come from home,” said Hester Laverack,
who had returned from Helen and
her refractory tea-things. Hester was
an English girl who had only been in
America about a year, and was not yet
quite accustomed to the rollicking ways
of the rest of the club. “I think,” she
went on slowly, “I may take my camera
down, if you like; it’ll be rather good fun
to take pictures of us all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed; you must take your
camera,” said Marjorie. “What larks!
We’ll have jolly pictures. And if Helen
takes her banjo we can sing songs and
have concerts, and—oh, dear, the time
won’t be half long enough!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send me up a picture of the group
when you’ve spoiled your dinner in the
cooking, and haven’t anything to eat,”
said grandma, slyly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Grandma Cassandra, you mustn’t
talk like that,” said Marjorie; “but
you can’t dampen our spirits with your
dire prognostications; we have too much
confidence in our own capabilities. Skip
along, girls; I’m going to get ready now,
and we’ll all meet at the station.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd scattered, and Millicent
Payne said: “Well, I’m the last little
Injun, and I reckon I’ll go too, and then
there’ll be none.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Millicent Payne was Marjorie’s dearest
friend and chum, and lived next door; at
least, she was supposed to, but she almost
lived at the Bonds’. Millicent was a delightful
girl to know; she was so clever
and bright, and took such an interest in
anything that interested anybody else—such
a kind, whole-hearted interest, that
was neither curious nor critical. And she
had such funny little tricks of imagination.
If, for any reason, her surroundings were
not quite what she wished they were, she
immediately created for herself an environment
that suited her better, and, quite
oblivious of facts, lived and moved among
her fancies. She was devoted to stories
and fairy-tales, and would repeat them in
an irresistibly funny manner, becoming at
times so imbued with the spirit of fantasy
that she seemed a veritable witch or pixy
herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Run along, Millikens,” called Marjorie.
“Come back when you’re ready, and
we’ll go down together.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1.1em;'>ON THE ROAD</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE clock in the railroad station announced
high noon, but of all the
party only Marjorie and Millicent were
there to hear it. Nan Kellogg had fulfilled
her own prophecy by coming down
fifteen minutes earlier, and then going
back home for her cuckoo-clock, which
was one of her pet possessions, and which
she decided she couldn’t be parted from
for two whole weeks. She came flying
back, and entered the station by one door
just as Betty Miller came in at the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Nan, breathlessly, “I
thought of course I’d be the last one here.
Where are the other girls? But since
they’re not here, won’t you hold the clock,
Marjorie, and let me run back home
and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Betty, decidedly. “You
can<span class='it'>not</span> go back for anything else. Follow
the example of your clock and stop running
for a while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has it stopped? I was afraid it would.
Never mind; I can set it going after we
get there. But I do want to go back
and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nan Kellogg, you’ll be put in chains
if you are so insubordinate,” broke in
Marjorie. “I am commander of this expedition,
and I order you to sit down on
that bench and not move until the train
comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan laughed, but sat down obediently,
holding her precious clock; and then
Helen appeared with her banjo, and Hester
with her camera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you checked your wheels,
girls?” asked Betty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, with our trunks,” said Helen.
“Mr. Bond is keeping watch over them
until the train comes; and he is holding
Timmy Loo, who is a most important-looking
animal just now, dressed in a new
red ribbon and a baggage-tag.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he’s delighted with his prospective
journey,” said Marjorie. “I told him
he had the entire charge of our trunks and
wheels, and he feels the responsibility.
Oh, here’s Jessie. Now we’re all here but
Marguerite. Where is she, Nan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who? Daisy? Oh, she’ll be here in
a minute. I think she waited to learn
how to make soup.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll be in it if she doesn’t hurry,”
said Nan. “I think I’ll go and poke her
up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t do it!” cried Betty. “You’ll
miss her, and then we won’t have either of
you. Here she comes now, grinning like
a Chessy cat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dainty Marguerite, in her fresh white
duck suit and pink shirt-waist, came in,
smiling radiantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='i035'></a></p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“ ‘MR. BOND IS HOLDING TIMMY LOO.’ SAID HELEN.”</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Girls,” said she, “Aunt Annie was at
our house, and she taught me a new soup.
It’s wonderful, and I’ll make it for you,
if you want it, the first thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course we want it the first thing,”
said Nan. “Did you suppose we thought
it was a dessert?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, girls!” called Mr. Bond, from
the platform, as the train that was to have
the honor of carrying the party puffed
into the station and came noisily to a
standstill. “Are you ready? All aboard!
Good-by, Margy dear; don’t set the house
afire. Who is the Matron of this crowd,
anyway? I’d like a word with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marjorie looked at the girls. “I think
Marguerite is,” she said. “She’s the
youngest and smallest and rattle-patedest.
Yes, she shall be our Matron.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, then, Matron Daisy, I consign
these young barbarians to your care,
and I put them and my house in your
charge, and I shall expect you to render
me an account when you come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t scare me, Mr. Bond,” pleaded
Marguerite, shaking her yellow curls. “If
the responsibility proves too much for me
I shall run away and leave them to their
fate. But I think I can manage them,
and I’ll rule them with a rod of iron.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the bell rang, and Mr. Bond
jumped off the train just in time; and he
waved his hat, and the girls waved their
handkerchiefs from the windows, until
they were whisked away out of his sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, my children,” said Marguerite,
highly elated at her absurd title of Matron,
“you are in my care, and I must
look after you. Why, where are Nan
and Helen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sure enough, only six of the girls were
to be seen; but just at that moment the
two missing ones were escorted through
the now wabbling doorway by an official.
They were rather red-faced, and explained
that they had seated themselves
in the smoking-car by mistake, and the
brakeman had kindly brought them back
to their friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am shocked,” said Marguerite, severely.
“Sit down there at once, and after
this follow my directions more closely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the eight girls were quickly paired
off, and the general chatter was broken
up into dialogues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mindful of her position as Matron,
Marguerite kept a watchful eye on her
charges. To be sure, the watchful eye
was so bright and merry that as a means
of restraint it was practically useless.
But the Blue Ribbon Cooking Club knew
how to behave itself in a public conveyance—oh,
dear, yes! and, save for a few
sudden and really unavoidable bursts of
merriment, it was as proper and decorous
a rosebud garland of girls as one could
wish to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To be sure, there was some commotion
when the conductor asked for Marguerite’s
ticket, and she suddenly remembered she
had written Aunt Annie’s soup recipe on
the back of it, intending to copy it before
the conductor came around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was the only bit of paper I had,”
she explained, “and it is such a good
recipe. What shall I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan had a blank-book with her which
she always carried in case of poetic fire,
and the conductor obligingly left the soup-ticket,
as Betty called it, for them to copy,
and returned later to receive the yellow
card, much crumpled by the process of
erasure. But the precious recipe was
safe, and at least one page of Nan’s book
was worth having.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there was another mild excitement
when Nan’s cuckoo-clock, which was
carefully laid away up in the rack, suddenly
announced in shrill pipes that it was
twelve o’clock. It wasn’t twelve o’clock
at all, and that rascally cuckoo knew it;
but having been silenced by Nan’s breathless
run down to the station, he was well
pleased to be set going again by the jar
of the train, and he chirped his twelve
double notes with an evident enjoyment
of the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan tried her best to look unconscious,
but only succeeded in looking so funny
that the girls went off into peals of
laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty leaned over, and picking up Nan’s
blank-book, scribbled in it:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Nannie had a little clock,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;But it was rather slow;</p>
<p class='line0'>And when she thought that it had stopped,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The clock was sure to go.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This was passed around, and caused
such hilarity that Marguerite confiscated
the book and, assuming an air of rigid
decorum, sat staring straight before her
with all the appalling dignity of a blonde
wax doll.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon which, Millicent slyly regained
the book, unobserved by the stern Matron,
and drew a funny sketch of Marguerite
wearing epaulets and a cocked hat,
mounted on a fiery steed, and commanding
a great army. The curly mop of
hair, the stiff duck skirt, and the side-saddle,
contrasted with the military pose
and uplifted sword, was very funny; and
when Millicent labeled it “A Daisy Napoleon,”
and passed it over to Betty and
Jessie, they giggled outright. But now
they had passed Spring Grove, and the
next station would be Long Beach.
Gathering up their belongings, they were
all ready, when the train stopped, to jump
out on the platform, and there they found
Uncle Ned and Aunt Molly waiting for
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All here?” sang out Uncle Ned, in
his cheery way. “Where are your
checks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dozen metal medals were produced
by Betty, who announced herself as
Courier. It was an appalling lot of luggage
to which these checks entitled Uncle
Ned; but he soon found a man with a
big wagon, and trunks, wheels, and boxes
were lifted into it and despatched to the
cottage, while Marjorie received frantic
expressions of affection from Timmy Loo,
who had had quite enough of baggage-cars
for one while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Ned politely put the spare seats
of his carriage at the disposal of the girls,
but the loyal crowd refused to be divided.
Not they indeed! They would find a
conveyance that would hold them all, or
they would walk. It was only about a
mile. But a capacious stage lumbered
up, and the whole eight were bundled
into it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timmy Loo, as was his custom when
riding, jumped up on Marjorie’s shoulder,
and sat there fairly quivering with curiosity
to know what kind of a performance
was going on, anyway. For his part, he
couldn’t understand it at all. But Marjorie
gave him a little whack on his nose,
and he subsided into a wary indifference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Want any milk?” The loud words
seemed to roll in at the door of the stage,
and there on the steps stood a burly, red-faced
man, smiling with fun and curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard as how you young ladies was
a-comin’, an’ I thought as you might want
to engage milk at onct.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not now, please,” said Marguerite,
who sat in the end of the stage, and who
was startled by the sudden apparition.
“Come round to the house after we get
settled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, mum; thank ye, mum!”
And the red-faced one disappeared as
mysteriously as he had come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wasn’t he awful?” said Marguerite.
“He hopped up like a jack-in-the-box,
and that off-with-his-head tone of voice
scared me out of my wits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that was old Farmer Hobbs,” said
Marjorie, laughing; “he always brings
us milk when we’re here in the summer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s the ocean, Nan; get out your
best pensive expression and put it on,”
cried Betty, as the stage bumped around
a corner and the blue sea shone before
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nan was already wearing what the
girls called her rapt look, and she paid no
attention to their banter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Roll on, thou deep and dark blue
ocean, roll!’ ” began Millicent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Should you dry up, ’twould leave an
awful hole,” continued Marjorie. “Oh,
how good this salt air is! It makes me
feel like a mermaid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has a worse effect on me than
that,” exclaimed Betty. “It makes me
just awfully hungry. Do we really have
to get settled to housekeeping and all
that before we can have anything to eat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed,” said Marjorie; “we’ll
have a picnic supper as soon as we can
get enough things unpacked to have it
with, and then we’ll begin our regular
living to-morrow. There’s the house,
girls; that shingled one next to the one
with the yellow dog in front of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in another minute they had
stopped in front of the shingled house
and were tumbling over one another out
of the stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan landed first, and no sooner had
she touched the ground than, as if by
magic, a swarm of men appeared, who
gathered round her, outvying each other
in impressive politeness, and offered her
cards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bewildered at the suddenness of the
onslaught, Nan glanced helplessly at
Marjorie with a scared “What <span class='it'>do</span> they
want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this the swarm turned their attention
to Marjorie and the cards were pointed
at her, while the men stood respectfully
silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duchess, though as ignorant as
Nan of the nature of the bits of pasteboard
thrust upon her, summoned all her dignity
to her aid, and sternly demanded:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What <span class='it'>do</span> you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the answers came from a dozen
manly throats in such a jumble that no
word was intelligible. Then, looking at
two cards which had been fairly pushed
into her hands, she read on one:</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/card1.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0004' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='noindent'>and on the other:</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/card2.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0005' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then these two rival butchers began each
to dilate on his superiority over all other
butchers that ever had been or ever would
be at Long Beach, and each claimed the
honor of having supplied the first families
there since the settlement of the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marjorie, alive to the fun of the thing,
tried to make a decision. Finally she
said: “I will order meat from one of you
to-day, and the other to-morrow, and
whichever sends me the best meats I will
continue to patronize. And I will try first
the one whose card is decorated with this
very beautiful cow’s head. That’s you,
Mr. Parkins. But I can’t order now, for
I’m too busy. Come around again in
about an hour. And you, Mr. Merton &amp;
Finch, may come to-morrow morning for
your order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, mum,” said the two men, and,
gallantly lifting their caps, they went
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cards of the other men announced
them to be fish and vegetable merchants,
bakers and milkmen, and one, being card-less,
declared himself the coal and wood
agent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We may as well order that at once,”
said Marjorie, reflectively. “Please send
us a barrel of kindling-wood and a—Girls,
how much coal ought we to have
for two weeks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A ton, I should think,” said Marguerite,
with an air of superior wisdom
that made her look like the canary who
wanted to be an owl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crazy Daisy!” said Betty. “We
couldn’t <span class='it'>begin</span> to use a ton, nor a half,
nor a quarter. Why, we only use twenty
tons for a whole year at home, radiators
and all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If six Millers in one year burn twenty
tons, how much is necessary to supply one
Miller and seven other insects that they
may have coal to burn?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be Stoker,” said Hester Laverack.
“The only thing I’m a real success at is
making a fire and keeping it going. And
<span class='it'>I</span> think we’ll need a barrel of coal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A barrel! Just the thing!” cried
Betty. “That’s lots better than a fraction
of a ton; and there are so few fractions
of a ton to choose from.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Marjorie; “you may
send us a barrel of coal and some wood
for the open fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A quarter of a cord?” suggested the
man, as if he feared another lengthy discussion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Marjorie, breathing a
sigh of relief as he went away. Then
she stood looking helplessly at her handful
of cards. “Girls,” said she, “the
responsibilities of housekeeping are wearing
me out, and we haven’t even entered
the house yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are the keys?” said impatient
Marguerite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marjorie flourished her bunch of keys
importantly, unlocked the door, and, with
a wild whoop from Betty and a responsive
bark from Timmy Loo they all went in.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1.1em;'>THE FUN BEGINS</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>‟S</span>AVED! I have fallen into a grotto!”
exclaimed Millicent, dashing through
the hall and into the parlor, where she
flung herself into a big wicker rocker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by that?” said
Hester, who always liked to have everything
explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, don’t you remember that ridiculous
hero in one of Jules Verne’s stories
who fell thousands of miles down into
the earth, and landed in a beautiful grotto,
which caused him delight but no surprise?
Those are exactly my sensations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, your grotto is full of unused
atmosphere. Let’s turn it out and get
some fresh.” And swish! up went the
shades, and bang! up went the windows,
and in came the air and sunlight; and
after eight girls had flung down their
hats and wraps and bags and bundles the
place began to look quite homelike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here are the trunks and bicycles,”
cried Helen, as a wagon stopped before
the cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear,” said Marjorie, “we haven’t
chosen our rooms yet! Two will have to
sleep downstairs. Who wants to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” said Betty. “I’m not afraid;
are you, Jessie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed!” And the Invincibles
immediately appropriated the pretty bedroom
that opened off the parlor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haven’t I told you about these two
girls yet? Well, Betty was fifteen, a
very tall girl, with that kind of tallness
that is called overgrown. She was fond
of all outdoor sports, and strong, athletic,
and muscular, she strode through life
regardless of conventions, but making
friends as she went. Jessie was of directly
opposite type in most ways. A
chubby little maiden with a happy-go-lucky
disposition, she had a positive
genius for getting her own way. Always
amiable and acquiescent, and very generous,
she yet managed never to do anything
she didn’t wish to do. She was a
frivolous little creature, devoted to finery
and dress, but so winning and affectionate
that it was really impossible to interfere
with her wishes. And so Betty’s
determination and Jessie’s persistency
had won them the name of the Invincibles,
and whatever they agreed on always came
to pass. But as they rarely agreed on
anything this was not so disastrous as it
might have been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The social economy of the eight was
very clearly defined. The Octave, as
they called themselves, divided very naturally
into two quartets or four duets
whenever occasion required. And just
now occasion did require; so, leaving
Betty and Jessie, the other six flew upstairs,
and Marjorie and Millicent took
one room, Nan and Marguerite another,
and Helen and Hester the third, so that
when the trunks were sent up they were
put at once where they belonged. The
wheels were stacked in the hall—only five
of them, for Millicent, Nan, and Marguerite
didn’t ride. Then the trunks were
unpacked, shelves divided fairly, hooks
counted out, top bureau drawers tossed up
for, and the settling process had begun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon Betty’s voice was heard from below:
“Don’t fiddle with your finery any
longer now, girls; come on down and
let’s see about supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The six upstairs, feeling a responsive
thrill, suspended operations at once and
skipped down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they all flocked out to the kitchen,
and great and joyous were the exclamations
of the Blue Ribbon Cooking Club
when they beheld the completeness of the
furnishings thereof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old corner cupboard disclosed griddles
and gridirons, saucepans and frying-pans;
rows of shining tins hung over the
sink; egg-beaters and syllabub-churns
smiled out at them from the shelves; and
a big fat pudding-mold beamed a welcome
from its corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty seized two tin kettle-covers, and,
clashing them like cymbals, broke into the
club’s “battle-song,” which they sang on
every possible occasion. Marjorie played
an accompaniment on the coffee-mill,
Nan whisked in some trills with the egg-beater,
and they all sang:</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>A loud knock at the back door made
them all jump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You go, Marjorie,” said Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Marjorie opened the door and faced
again the persistent crowd of venders.
The Parkins butcher, the grocer, the
baker, milkman, vegetable-man, fish-man,
all stood, beaming and expectant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The club will please come to order!”
said Marjorie, turning to the girls. “These
claimants must be satisfied. <span class='it'>What</span>, ladies
of the Blue Ribbon Cooking Club, <span class='it'>what</span>,
I ask you, do you want to eat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A serious silence fell on the crowd.
They realized that at last they must cope
with the great question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll divide forces and appoint committees,”
went on the president. “Betty,
you and Jessie order the meat—whatever
you like; Nan, do up the baker; Marguerite,
the milkman; Helen and Hester,
reason with the vegetarian; and Millikens
and I will attend to the grocer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan soon despatched the baker with a
standing order of two loaves per day, subject
to amendment. Marguerite discussed
the milk problem at length with good-natured
old Farmer Hobbs, and wound
up by deciding on two quarts every morning,
or three quarts if there was a clothes-pin
on the pail which he would find on
the back steps; also a quart of cream
each morning, with a like understanding
of the clothes-pin. “For,” said the sagacious
Matron, “what with whips and charlottes,
we’ll need a lot of cream.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen and Hester decided they would
attend to their department in an orderly
and systematic manner. Taking the index
of a cookery-book for a guide, they
decided they would eat their vegetables
alphabetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you any artichokes?” said
Hester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, mum,” replied the man, looking
as if she had asked for a salamander.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any Brussels sprouts?” asked Helen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, mum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any celery?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yis, mum; fine celery indeed. Will
ye look at it, mum?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We oughtn’t to have celery until day
after to-morrow,” said Helen, dubiously,
as they went out to the wagon, “but I
guess we’ll have to give up the alphabet
plan. Let’s order celery and potatoes.
And oh, look at that big pumpkin!
Wouldn’t a pumpkin-pie be grand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gay,” said Hester. “We’ll take that—and
that’s enough for to-day; you’ll
call to-morrow, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yis, mum,” replied the man; and
when the purchases were deposited on
the kitchen table Helen and Hester felt
proud of their choice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jessie had disappeared, but the stray
notes of song floating out from her room
made it an open secret that the attractions
of her trinkets and fripperies had charmed
her away from the culinary pastures. So
Betty faced the butcher alone. She was
very decided and businesslike. “We
want meat for supper to-night,” said she,
looking at Mr. Parkins’s card as if for inspiration.
“ ‘Beef, Veal, Mutton, Lamb,
Pork, and Poultry’—h’m! Well, we’ll
begin at the beginning. Beefsteak, I
think; you may send two nice porterhouse-steaks,
and please send them as
soon as possible. Then we’ll have a
roast for to-morrow—a two-rib roast of
beef; you may send that to-morrow
morning.” The butcher noted down her
orders, and went away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the only committee still out was
Marjorie and Millicent. When Betty,
having finished her course, turned to
them, they were in a wild state of excitement.
They had decided to suggest
things alternately, while the grocer wrote
the list.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grocer was a lanky, raw-boned
young man with bushy red hair, and,
seated in a chair with his pad and pencil,
looked for all the world like a district
schoolmaster; while the two girls stood
before him, looking like a very animated
spelling-match.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marjorie, dancing on one foot, was
twisting up the corners of her apron into
knots, which she tied and untied with unconscious
rapidity. Millicent stood firmly
facing her, with folded arms and screwed-up
forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Flour,” said Marjorie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Butter,” said Millicent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sugar,” said Marjorie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Salt,” said Millicent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pepper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mustard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ketchup.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sardines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Olives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we must get staples! Molasses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buckwheat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; we don’t want buckwheat.
Kerosene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes; and candles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Matches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Starch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t need starch. Corn-starch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eggs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vanilla.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Worcestershire sauce.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear! I’m sure we’ve forgotten the
most important things. Lard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We ought to have some canned
things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let him bring what we’ve ordered,
and then we can remember what
we’ve forgotten. Soap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ammonia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Salad-oil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now one thing suggests another!
Lemons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cheese.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Macaroni.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Macaroons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t keep those; the baker
does. Don’t let’s order any more things
now; I’m all mixed up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fenn went away well pleased with
his order, and Millicent dropped into a
kitchen chair exhausted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girls,” said Hester, “you’ve run up
an awful big order; <span class='it'>do</span> you suppose it will
cost all our money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” said the wise and matronly
Marguerite, shaking her halo; “and, besides,
most of those things won’t need to
be ordered again; the staples will last us
all the time we’re here. Now when they
bring the bills I’ll fix up my accounts.
I have a little red book, real Russia, and
I’ll have a page for each department.
Are these committees standing ones, Miss
President?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, <span class='it'>no!</span>” said Marjorie, “we’ll take
turns at things. I don’t want to order
groceries again. I’m quite worn out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Margy! ‘Come rest in this
bosom, my own stricken deer,’ ” sang Nan,
catching Marjorie about the waist and
dancing round the kitchen with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am <span class='it'>so</span> hungry!” pleaded Betty.
“Can’t we get out the silver and table-cloth
and set the table now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, come on; I love to set a table,”
said Nan. “But oh, <span class='it'>how</span> I hate to wash
dishes! I thought we were going to have
an Irish lady to do that, eh, Marjorie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aunt Molly says there’s a nice Irish
girl who lives up the beach somewhere
who would come and help us for a consideration.
You and Marguerite go
and hunt her up. Her name is Rosie
O’Neill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beautiful name!” said Nan.</p>

<p class='noindent'>There! we forgot to order apples.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s have a slate on the kitchen

they occur to us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Matron; we’ll go and hunt
the radiant Rosie. Where does she live,
Duchess?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know. Stop in and ask
Aunt Molly; she’ll direct you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis well, O chief! We will return in
triumph with our enchainèd captive!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said Marjorie, as the door
banged behind Nan and Marguerite,
“those rattle-pated girls are sure to get
lost, and we’ll never see them again.
Meantime let’s get to work. We haven’t
explored the cellar yet. Perhaps the
people who’ve been in the cottage all
summer left a lot of good things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down cellar they went; but a thorough
search revealed nothing of interest but a
basket of onions, a refrigerator, and an
old trunk, which attracted Hester’s attention
at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that’s a real old English trunk!”
she cried. “Where did it come from?
It’s locked, and the lock is all rusty.
What do you find, Marjorie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing but onions and flour; but the
flour looks queer—I don’t believe it’s
good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That isn’t flour, you goose; it’s Indian
meal. It’ll be gay for corn-bread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who can make corn-bread? <span class='it'>I</span> can’t,”
confessed Betty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, you can, if you try,” declared
Marjorie. “Your cooking always turns
out all right. Now, as we’re going to
have steak for supper, what do you say
to having fried onions? There are plenty
here, and I do love ’em, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; and we never have them at
home, they’re so—so intrusive. Let’s
do it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Betty; and as you’ve announced
yourself Peeler, you can begin
your vocation. Oh, you’ve got a future
before you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty looked a little dubious, but
bravely picked up the basket, saying:
“Very well; I’ll peel them, if some one
else will fry them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll fry them,” returned Marjorie.
“In my capacity of chief cook I’ll do all
the cooking for this first supper. Now
let me see; what are we going to have?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The others, as usual, all began to talk
at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marjorie seized a long iron spoon,
and, rapping on the table, said: “This
meeting will please come to order. If
you don’t we’ll never have any supper.
Now don’t all talk at once, but if you’ve
any sensible propositions to make, make
them when you’re called on. Betty the
Peeler, have you any suggestions to
offer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Betty was speechless. She held a
great pan filled with water in her lap, in
which the onions were bobbing up and
down. She was peeling away vigorously,
but her eyes were very red and the tears
were rolling down her cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘With a smile on her lip and a tear in
her eye,’ ” quoted Marjorie, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s more like Niobe—<span class='it'>all</span> tears,”
said Helen; “come, Hester, let’s wipe her
weeping eyes for her”; and the two stationed
themselves on either side of Betty,
with their handkerchiefs in readiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now!” said Helen,“left! right! left!
right!” And they dabbed poor Betty’s
eyes so energetically that they were redder
than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clear out, girls, or you’ll soon weep
with those that weep,” cried Betty. “Go
away; these are nearly done. Who’ll
carry out the pan of skins?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh, promise me—oh, <span class='it'>prom</span>ise me-e-e!’ ”
came floating out from the bedroom
where Jessie was still arranging
and rearranging her cherished belongings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jessie ought to do <span class='it'>some</span> work,” said
Millicent. “She’s too dainty and dressy
for any use. She ought to be disciplined.
Let’s make her come out here and be
Scullery-maid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they all crowded in at Jessie’s doorway,
and found her sitting on the floor by
her open trunk, surrounded by laces and
ribbons and fans, and still musically begging
the required promise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll promise you nothing until you
come out and do some work for it,” said
Marjorie. “So get up at once.” Then,
picking up an elaborate little Swiss apron,
she tied its ribbons round Jessie’s waist.
“There!” she said. “Now you’re appropriately
decorated, and I herewith
appoint you Scullery-maid of this institution.
Now skip along and empty that
pan of onion-skins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, <span class='it'>don’t</span> let her spoil that pretty
apron,” said Hester the practical, and she
took off her own big gingham one and
tied it over the dainty affair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this a game?” said Betty, taking off
her own apron and tying it over Hester’s
on Jessie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a flash the three other aprons
came off their owners and were piled
on the luckless Jessie—round her waist,
round her neck, before and behind, until
Millicent declared she looked like Tweedledee
prepared for his fight with Tweedledum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Good-natured Jessie trotted off with
the pan, and on her return was seized by
Betty the Peeler, who peeled off the
numerous aprons and restored them to
their owners.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1.1em;'>THE “WHITECAP”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>GAIN Marjorie rapped on the table
with her iron spoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As none of you seems to offer any
suggestions,” she went on, as if she had
not been interrupted at all, “I will lay
down the law. Hester, you’re Stoker.
The coal and wood has come. Now see
if you can make a fire that shall be worthy
of one whom England expects this day
to do her duty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, aye!” said Hester, bringing her
hand to her temple, palm forward, with
the quick, jerky salute of a British
marine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Helen, you and Jessie might set the
table; but don’t both of you get to singing
at once, for you’ll drive us distracted.
Millicent, what are <span class='it'>you</span> good for, anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Millicent was putting away the groceries
that were piled on the table in the
outer kitchen, or buttery, as Hester called
it, and she replied: “Oh, I would ornament
any calling; but when I see these
candles and kerosene it makes me just
long to fill the lamps and candlesticks,
’cause it’s going to get dark pretty
soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a wise virgin,” said Betty,
“and you shall be our honored Lamplighter.
I suppose I must peel these
potatoes. How many, Duchess?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two apiece,” replied Marjorie. “We’ll
have them mashed, and the onions fried,
and the steak broiled, and I’ll make coffee,
and that’s all we’ll have cooked for supper.
You can hunt up some dessert
out of the things that came from the
grocer’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many hands make light work, and in
half an hour everything was about ready.
The table was laid, and wonderfully
pretty it looked, too; for under Jessie’s
supervision it had blossomed out into
dainty doilies, and bits of shining glass
and silver; and in the center was a low
basket of goldenrod.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not finding a satisfactory dessert in
the cupboard, Helen had run over to the
grocer’s herself, and returned triumphantly
with a box of candied ginger, an
Edam cheese, and a tin box of biscuits.
These and the coffee-cups she arranged
on a side-table, and surveyed the result
with a very pardonable pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Millicent had filled and lighted the
large swinging-lamp over the table, and
candles twinkled from a pair of old-fashioned
candelabra which Jessie had
discovered in the attic. In the kitchen,
too, all was in readiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty had boiled and mashed the potatoes
until Millicent declared they looked
like cotton batting. Marjorie had broiled
the steak to the proverbial turn, fried the
onions to an odoriferous brown, and made
a potful of her celebrated coffee; and
now, flushed with success and Hester’s
fire, she sat on the edge of the kitchen
table, her iron spoon still in her hand, like
a scepter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whe-e-w!” said Helen, coming out.
“You must be cooking comparisons out
here, they’re so odorous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In onion is strength,” replied Betty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you take something for
that punning habit, Betty? Really, it’s
getting worse, I think. Oh, I wish Nan
and the Matron would come! I <span class='it'>am</span> so
starved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in a few minutes they did come—tired
and chilled with their long walk,
and without the much-desired Irish lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s your captive?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t you catch her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she coming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Marguerite, “it’s all right.
Don’t all talk at once; let me tell you.
She can’t come until to-morrow, but she’ll
be here early—before breakfast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we’ve got to wash the dishes
to-night, haven’t we?” groaned Jessie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, my pretty Scullery-maid,”
said Betty; “you needn’t do it: you can
put them away with neatness and despatch.”
And Jessie beamed again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you guess what we’re going to
have for supper?” said Marjorie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess!” said Nan. “I should think
we could! Why, we met the announcement
three blocks up the street, and it led
us all the way home, like the Israelites’
pillar of fire. Is supper ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” chimed a chorus; and in less
time than it takes to tell it the feast was
on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You sit at the head, Duchess,” said
Betty, “and I’ll sit at the foot and carve,
for none of the rest of you know how.
The fair Scullery-maid can sit at my right
hand in case I need her assistance, Nan
and Daisy next, then Millicent at Marjorie’s
right, and then Helen and Hester;
and there you are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There they were indeed, and a merrier
meal was never eaten by the Blue Ribbon
Cooking Club.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prosaic onions were pronounced
better than any complicated French concoction,
and were portioned out with exact
fairness by the conscientious Betty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan and Marguerite, having done nothing
toward the preparations, offered
their services as waitresses, and, like well-trained
club members, they removed one
course and served the other in the most
approved fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Marjorie poured coffee, and the
red-coated cheese was placed before
Betty, who thoroughly enjoyed “scooping,”
and there was much laughter and
merry talk. And they all complimented
each other and congratulated each other,
and they feasted and jested, and laughed
and chaffed; and as they all talked at
once, each made jokes that never were
heard, and told stories that never were
listened to, and asked questions that never
were answered. And Timmy Loo thought
it was all a great entertainment for his
special benefit; and he barked his funniest
barks, and ran round the table like
mad, and paused in front of each one,
standing up and putting out his paw in
his very best beggarly manner, receiving
always a bit of ginger or biscuit on his
solicitous little nose. Until finally Marjorie
said. “Now, sisters, if there’s any
redding up to be done, ’twere well ’twere
done quickly. I don’t mind washing the
dishes, and if we all fly round we’ll have
things in order in no time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They did fly round, and in very little
more than no time things were in order,
and the eight girls, feeling very proud of
their tidy kitchen, gathered round Hester’s
wood fire in the Grotto, as Millicent persisted
in calling the parlor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Uncle Ned and Aunt Molly
came over to call, and were nearly talked
to death by the enthusiastic eight, who
were delighted to have some one to “tell
things to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The much-amused guests were escorted
out to the kitchen to see how beautifully
the young housekeepers had “redded
up,” and then they were invited to partake
of crackers and cheese in the dining-room;
and such a hospitable spirit pervaded
the hostesses that they refreshed
themselves also, until the crackers were
all gone and the cheese required deep-sea
scooping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you certainly seem a capable
crowd,” said Aunt Molly, as she was
taking leave. “Are you sure you won’t
be afraid to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course they won’t,” said Uncle
Ned, in tones that would have inspired
confidence in a lame rabbit. “What is
there to be afraid of? Long Beach is the
safest old place in the world. But, my
lambs, if you want us at any hour of the
day or night, you’ve only to push this
bell in the hall, which communicates with
our bell, and we’ll fly over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said Matron Marguerite, as
they returned to the Grotto, “I am going
to make up my accounts. I have all the
bills that came in to-day, and I have five
dollars apiece from each one of you for
the first week, though I’m afraid it won’t
be enough, and Helen forgot to give me
hers anyway, and Betty gave hers to me
and then borrowed it back again; and I
haven’t paid my own yet either, but I
paid out eighty cents for our stage-fares,
and twenty-five cents expressage,—no,
fifty,—and fourteen cents for two quarts
of milk. You see, I didn’t know we were
going to have bills, and I almost wish we
hadn’t. Oh, yes, and I owe Marjorie
thirty-six cents that she paid to the butter-and-egg
lady—I mean the club owes
it. But I guess I can straighten it all
out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to have one of those cash-register
things,” said Millicent. “You
just play on it with your fingers, and it
rings a bell and counts your money for
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I had one,” said Marguerite,
who was beginning to be arithmetically
bewildered. “But I’ll be all right if you
girls will let me alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will, we will,” said Nan. “Just
remember, Daisy, that two and two
make four, and then go ahead. Now
<span class='it'>I</span>’m going to begin our Journal. I
brought a grand and elegant new blank-book
for the purpose. We must write
something in it every day, and we’ll keep
it here on the table where anyone can write
a page when she feels disposed. What
shall we call it? What’s the name of
this cottage, Marjorie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, father calls it Fair View, but I
don’t think that’s much of a name.
Let’s christen it for ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call it Liberty Hall,” said Jessie,
“because we’re going to do just as we
like all the time we’re here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too hackneyed,” returned Betty.
“Let’s call it Hilarity Hall, because
we’re going to have lots of fun here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Hilarity Hall it was, and Nan
printed it in big letters on the fly-leaf of
her book. Then she began to scribble,
and the others leaned over her shoulder
and knelt at her side, and helped and suggested
and amended, until the first instalment
of the Journal stood thus, and Nan
read it aloud, amid a fire of running comment:</p>

no poet, but I’ll write the kitchen chronicles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She scribbled away, reading aloud as
she wrote —</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“The dish-washing was exciting in the extreme.
The Duchess, being overcome at the sight of so
much work, was laid upon the buttery shelf.
The Duchess’s apron fell on the Peeler, who, with
the valuable assistance of the Stoker, smashed
three plates and a cup. The Poet, not seeing
the Matron, fell over her while crossing the
kitchen, which made the Matron cross (the
threshold). The Duchess (very naturally)
slipped off the buttery shelf, and the Wandering
Minstrel and Scullery-maid, sneaking
away from the glorious company of dish-washers,
made night hideous with their wild howlings in
the Grotto (banjo accompaniment).”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Lamplighter, give it to me. As
Matron I am the one to write up the
account of our social functions”; and
Marguerite threw down her account-book
and took the Journal, writing and reading:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Hilarity Hall was the scene of unparalleled
gaiety this evening, the occasion being a reception
which was tendered to distinguished
and honored guests, Sir Edward and Lady Mary.
The reception was held in the Grotto, after
which the Duchess led the way to the Refectory,
where a limited collation was enjoyed. The
honored guests then inspected the Cinderella
Section, and, expressing themselves much pleased
with their visit, they reluctantly departed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, this book is going to be fine,”
said Betty. “What shall we call it? Just
the Journal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; let’s call it ‘Annals of Hilarity
Hall,’ ” said Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are annals?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, but they’re things they
always have in a quiet neighborhood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think much of annals anyway,”
said Millicent; “let’s call it something
to do with cooking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; we have our ‘Blotter’ for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “Blotter” was the recipe scrap-book
of the club, and was supposed to be a very
funny joke on Professor Blot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not call it something to suggest
the sea?” said Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call it the Whitecap,” said Millicent.
“Then those who are prosaic can mean the
cook’s white cap, which is the badge of
our club, and poetic souls like Nan can
mean the whitecaps of the breaking
waves dashed high.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All agreed to this, and “The Whitecap”
was scrawled across the cover in
artistically uncertain characters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, my lambs, you must go to bed,”
said the Matron, ruffling up her halo and
looking very sleepy. “What time do we
rise, Duchess?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, whenever we unanimously agree
to. We’ll all call each other. Where are
your candles, Lamplighter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the hall table”; and, sure enough,
there stood eight candles, burning in a
heterogeneous assortment of candlesticks.
Helen grasped her banjo and began to
play a lullaby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put up the book, Poet, and come
along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nan was adding a final verse,
though her sleepy audience would scarcely

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE sun was shining o’er the sea,
shining with all its might, and had
been doing so for two hours, but no one
in Hilarity Hall had awakened to the
fact. A loud rap at the kitchen door
partially roused sleepy Jessie, who murmured,
“Yes, mamma,” and dozed off
again. But Betty was thoroughly awakened
by the sound, and, giving Jessie a
shake, she exclaimed: “I believe it’s that
horde of men again!” Then, springing
up, she began to dress hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The knocking not only continued but
was supplemented by other peremptory
sounds,—a ring at the front-door bell, a
toot on a tin fish-horn, the postman’s
whistle,—all of which were responded
to by frantic barkings from Timmy Loo,
who tore madly from one door to another,
bouncing at last into Betty’s room and
waltzing before her on his hind legs. His
fat little body was quivering with excitement,
and his bright eyes blinked through
the wispy locks that hung over them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Betty was struggling with a stiff
shirt-waist and a pair of sleeve-links, and
her fruitless endeavors to bring them into
harmony rendered her incapable of good
work in that direction. Then Timmy Loo
grew wheedlesome and patted Betty’s
foot, as was his custom when he wanted
anybody to go anywhere. Betty pushed
him aside, a little impatiently it seemed to
Tim, and he ran to Jessie, who was enjoying
the added luxury of Betty’s pillow,
and looking as if she would stay there undisturbed
though China fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the second-story contingent was
also aroused by this time, and six frowzled
heads hung over the banister and twelve
bare feet poked themselves between the
rails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you go, Betty?” said Marguerite’s
plaintive voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be down in a minute,” sang out
Marjorie, as she skipped back to her room
and made things fly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, hang!” said Betty, throwing her
links down on the bureau and flinging her
shirt-waist across the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take mine, dear,” said Jessie, placidly;
“it’s on that chair, and the buttons are all
in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty’s face cleared, and she slipped
on Jessie’s waist in a jiffy, and was at the
front door in another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There she found the postman and a
pleasant-faced Irish girl who said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m Rosie, mum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are indeed,” said Betty, looking
at her red cheeks; “come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then Hester landed in the lower
hall with a jump which had included the
last four stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad to see you, Rosie,” said she,
kindly; “come along with us and we’ll
face the bombardment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosie, looking somewhat bewildered,
followed the two girls to the kitchen.
Going through, Betty unlocked the door
which opened into a sort of outer kitchen
or shed with latticed and morning-gloried
walls. The door of the shed too was
barred, and when this was finally unfastened,
instead of the looked-for multitude
they saw only the red-haired grocer sitting
dejectedly on the stump of a tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took off his cap as he saw the girls,
and his hair blazed merrily in the sunshine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Morning, young ladies,” said he; “the
fish-man he couldn’t wait no longer,
and the vegetable-man likewise was in a
hurry. But I sez, I’ll wait, fer like as
not there’ll be things you fergot overnight,
besides fresh orders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Hester, abstractedly; “but
couldn’t you come round again later?
We’re—we haven’t decided yet what we
<span class='it'>do</span> want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, no, mum, I couldn’t call later—not
to say <span class='it'>later</span>. I’ll be round again to
<span class='it'>de</span>liver the goods, but not to take orders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you what, Hester,” said Betty;
“don’t order now, and after breakfast
some of us can ride over on our wheels
and leave the order in time for him to
bring the things. Er—what shall I call
you, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dan’l, mum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Daniel, we won’t give you any
order now, but we’ll send it over to the
store.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, mum”; and looking a little
injured, the red-haired one shambled off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said Betty, “we must have
breakfast first of all; and as I cooked
most of the dinner last night, it isn’t my
turn this morning. Marguerite’s the
Matron of this establishment, and I
think she ought to assume some responsibility.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” said Betty; “let’s go and
read the Riot Act to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Hester; “let’s write a mandamus
or habeas corpus or whatever they
call it, and send it up to her by Rosie,
and we’ll go for a spin on our wheels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whisking a leaf off the order-pad,
Betty wrote in large letters:</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“There, Rosie; take that upstairs,
please, and knock at the first door at the
head of the stairs, and give this to the
young lady with the fly-away yellow hair:
the one that came to see you last night,
you know—Miss Marguerite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, mum,” said Rosie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Hester and Betty each drank a
tumblerful of the fresh milk Farmer Hobbs
had brought, and in great glee started off
on their wheels, while Timmy Loo scampered
along behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems mean to run away,” said
Hester; but Betty replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all; it’s only fair that Daisy
should do some work. Let’s go around
by the church and down that road to the
beach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosie started obediently on her errand;
but Jessie stopped her as she passed the
door, inquiring:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did the girls go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cudden’t tell ye, miss; they wint
galloping away on their bicycles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They did! What about breakfast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They towld me to give this note to
Miss Margreet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oho!” said Jessie, reading the notice,
“they did, did they? Well, take it up,
Rosie.” And Jessie sauntered out on
the piazza and sniffed the salt morning
air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosie went upstairs with the note, but
her knock at the door received no response.
After another gentle rap she
opened the door, to find the room vacated.
The bed-clothing was thrown back and
the windows wide open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Faix, they’ve been shpirited away,”
thought the astonished maid. “If this
ain’t the quarest family! I’ll be l’avin’
if things goes on like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncertain how to proceed, she returned
to the kitchen, and sat down with folded
hands to await developments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen came downstairs next. Seeing
nobody around, she went into the kitchen,
and looked amazed at the solitary
Rosie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where <span class='it'>is</span> everybody?” began Helen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, I don’t know, mum. Thim as
was in the house wint out, and the rest
was gone before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of all performances!” And
Helen wandered out to the front veranda,
and discovered Jessie there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the front door of Hilarity Hall
was at the side, and so faced Aunt Molly’s
front door, which was also on the side.
And just as the two puzzled-looking
maidens met on their veranda, Aunt
Molly stepped out on hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, girlies! Had your
breakfast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said they.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come over and breakfast with us,”
cried jolly Uncle Ned, not expecting at
all that they would do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Helen replied: “Indeed we will;
for I’m awfully hungry, and it doesn’t
look at all hopeful over here.” And the
two girls ran across and gratefully seated
themselves at Aunt Molly’s cozy table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that’s how it happened that the
mystified Rosie waited alone in the silent
kitchen until she could stand it no longer,
and resolved to take her hat and go home.
But first she thought she would go upstairs
and make sure that the fairy-like
“Miss Margreet” had not reappeared in
the same mysterious fashion in which she
must have taken her departure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But no, she found the room still empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncertain what to do, she opened the
door of the next room, and there were
Millicent and Marjorie, who had returned
to bed and to sleep, just waking up,
startled at the sudden apparition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The apparition was startled, too, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, young ladies, I was thot shcared!
Sure there’s nobody in the house at all,
at all—savin’ your prisince.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Millicent could think of no explanation
for this extraordinary statement, but that
didn’t bother her in the least. Here was
a dramatic situation just to her mind, and
she grasped it at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you?” she said in a low,
mysterious whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosie O’Neill, miss,” said the Irish
girl, fascinated by Millicent’s gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roseoneal,” continued Millicent, pronouncing
it as if it were one word, and
speaking in a thrilling tone, “I am a
Princess—the Princess Millikens. This
lady beside me is my first gold-stick in
waiting. But, alas! we are under an enchantment,
and dare not leave this bed.
If I were to set foot to the floor I should
at once be changed into a red dragon
breathing forth fire and flames.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lor’, miss!” exclaimed Rosie,
clasping her hands and gazing, horror-stricken,
at Millicent’s tragic face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there is one thing that will break
the direful spell,” went on the mendacious
maiden. “If any one should bring me a
mug of mead and a golden pomegranate,
I would be freed from the enchantment
and regain my liberty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s thim things, miss? Could I
get ’em fer ye?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, no! they grow in the land of
the cypress and myrtle, where Afric’s
sunny fountains roll down their golden
sand. But a base imitation <span class='it'>might</span> answer
the purpose. Is there aught of food
below?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='i103'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i103.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0008' style='width:90%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“ ‘WHO ARE YOU?’ SHE SAID IN A LOW, MYSTERIOUS WHISPER.”</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Plenty of milk an’ bread, miss; an’
I can make you a toast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roseoneal, truly thou art a man-of-infinite-resource-and-sagacity.
But, stay!
Can you indeed make a golden toast
which may play the part of the missing
pomegranate? I want no slice of charred
bread. Listen! I will give minute directions
which, if faithfully carried out,
<span class='it'>may</span> be the means of releasing my Royal
Highness and my gold-stick, who is,
alas! dumb and all unable to speak for
herself, from our unfortunate predicament.
First, cut two slices from last
night’s loaf—this morning’s bread is too
fresh to toast. Let them be of even thickness,
about the thickness of—of a lead-pencil.
Then, having trimmed off the
upper crusts, lay them in the oven—the
slices, I mean, not the crusts. Then get
the little Japanese tray from the sideboard,
and lay on it a fresh napkin from
the upper drawer; find one that fits.
Then add two of those gold-edged plates
and two thin glass tumblers. Now pour
milk in the tumblers until it reaches three
quarters of an inch from the top; but
have a care that no drip or drop appears
on the glass above the sea-level. Have a
bit of butter in readiness. And now
comes the exciting part. Toast your
bread over a clear, bright fire. Have you
one handy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, miss—Princess, I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right. Or say, ‘Yes, your
Royal Highness.’ Well, then, make your
toast with the greatest care; brown first
one side and then the other until each is a
clear, golden crisp that <span class='it'>may</span> deceive the
enchanter into thinking it is the golden
pomegranate. Then, the moment it is
done, spread it lightly with the bit of
butter, lay it on the plate, and fly upstairs,
that we may nibble the portion in all its
pristine hotness. Hast thou understood
me, O maiden?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, your Royal Highness; but
wouldn’t you like some jam?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roseoneal, I am your friend, and
therefore your future is assured. Right
heartily will I like jam, if jam there be.
Place a generous spoonful on a small
glass saucer, but prepare it ere thou toastest
thy toast. And lay also on the tray a
silver knife and spoon. Now hie thee to
thy task, and we may yet cheat the
enchanter of his dire intent. But beware
of a crumb or a drop out of place! All is
lost unless it be conveyed hither with
neatness and despatch. And before you
go please hand me my gold crown which
is on the bureau.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see it, your Highness; there’s
nothing here but brushes and hair-pins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! has my crown been stolen?
Alackaday! What shall I do? Bring
me then a bunch of goldenrod, and we
may devise a temporary coronet that
shall at least proclaim my rank and station.
Disappear!” And Millicent waved
her hands with such an impressive gesture
that Rosie shot out of the door as if
under the influence of a real enchantment.
Marjorie lay back on her pillows choking
with laughter at Millicent’s dramatics,
and wondering whether Rosie would
really bring them some breakfast.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>‟I</span>SN’T it splendiferous!” cried Betty,
as they reached the beach. “Hester
Laverack, you are the most exasperating
girl! You just sit there like a bump on
a log. Why don’t you shout, or turn a
handspring, or do something to express
your delight?”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>said Hester; “ ’tisn’t <span class='it'>my</span> nature to. I’m
enjoying it all just as much as you are,
but I don’t make such a fuss about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t see how any one can look
at that great, boiling blue ocean, and
those jolly big waves coming up ker-smash!
and not feel like yelling. I shall
have to burst into song. ‘Co<span class='it'>lum</span>bia the
<span class='it'>gem</span> of the <span class='it'>o</span>-shun!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betty, you haven’t a speck of romance
in your nature,” said Hester, laughing.
“Now if Daisy were here she’d
quote an appropriate ditty instead of
howling a national air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh! I’d rather have <span class='it'>real</span> patriotism
than all Daisy’s make-believe romantic
notions. She puts on all that, but she
can’t fool me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t think she pretends always.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she does; she’s never sincere;
and that’s the one thing I can’t stand. I’d
rather be honest and say what I mean
than to be the petted favorite of everybody,
as she is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marguerite has so many talents,” put
in Hester; “she does everything so well
that people can’t help praising her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She <span class='it'>doesn’t</span> do things well,” went on
Betty; “she pretends to. But she’s lazy,
and she thinks whenever she gets half a
chance—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear!” said Hester. “Don’t let’s
be so hard on poor Daisy, especially when
she’s hard at work getting our breakfast.
Let’s take a run to the end of the board
walk and back, and then go up to the
house, for even a snail would have breakfast
ready by that time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls got up and shook off a flying
shower of sand which nearly buried poor
Timmy Loo. But he did some shaking
on his own account, and scampered along
beside them. All at once he gave a
squeal and darted ahead, and then flew
back with a great news written all over
his funny little face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s found somebody,” said Hester.
“Who is it, Tim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tim flew round the corner of an old
pier, the girls followed, and there, leaning
cozily against a post, were Marguerite and
Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you come for us?” said Marguerite.
“We were just going to start.
We’ve been here a long while, and we’ve
had the loveliest time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have!” exclaimed Hester. “How
did you get here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two scapegraces laughed, and Nan
said: “Well, you see, it was such a pleasant
morning, and such a short walk, we
left our hats to home, and, not to disturb
the rest of you, we climbed out of our
window, and crawled down that low
sloping roof, and jumped off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you didn’t get our note?” said
Betty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What note?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, girls, there’s no breakfast ready—or
anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” confessed Marguerite, “when
we jumped down by the shed steps, there
was the pail of milk, and—we just took a
drink, and, truly, we didn’t mean to stay
so long; but Nannie’s been writing a
poem, and I hated to interrupt her till she
finished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes,” said Betty, “that’s all
very well; but I’m hungry as a bear, and
I’m going home to forage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The others agreed to this, and Betty
and Hester led their wheels, while they
all walked along together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half-way home they met Helen and
Jessie coming down to the beach. A
general explanation followed, and Marjorie
exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we are the best set of housekeepers
I ever <span class='it'>did</span> see! But perhaps that
duck of a Millicent has a gay old breakfast
all ready for us. It would be just
like her to do it, and I say let’s hurry up
and not keep her waiting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen and Jessie turned back with
them to see the fun; and the six, with
Timmy Loo at their heels, burst into the
house. No one was in sight; but as the
little dog wagged his sagacious tail and
hopped upstairs, they all followed and
bundled into Millicent’s room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That absurd damsel was still in bed,
propped up against a pillowy background;
a red shawl draped her shoulders, and a
wabbly wreath of goldenrod lay gracefully
on her black curls, while a shaking
mound under the bed-covers was the only
indication of Marjorie’s presence. Rosie
sat on the edge of a chair, her hands
tightly clasped and her eyes wide open,
enthralled by the tales of magical experiences
that Millicent was dramatically
pouring forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Millicent Payne!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Marjorie Bond!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For goodness’ sake!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you <span class='it'>are</span> nice ones!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at that tray!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These exclamations, being all shouted
at once, conveyed no intelligence, and
the serene Millicent waved her scepter,
which was a long stalk of goldenrod,
and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Minions and slaves, how dare you
rush thus unannounced into the royal
presence? And—where in the world
have you been?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerted explanation followed, and
Marguerite protested so prettily that she
would gladly have prepared breakfast if
she had received the notice before she
jumped out of the window that of course
she was forgiven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timmy Loo had stationed himself before
the table which held the tray of empty
dishes, and sat up motionless, his fore paw
extended in his very best beggarly
manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You precious poodle-puppy,” said
Marjorie, catching him up. “You haven’t
had a single speck to eat this day; and I
think it’s a shame, so I do! Girls, we’re
a high old cooking club; we’ve been
here nearly twenty-four hours and we’ve
had <span class='it'>one</span> meal! Now I call a conference
of the powers, and let’s settle on some
definite line of action, or we’ll have the
agent from the Associated Charities down
here giving us soup-tickets. Rosie,
won’t you please take Tim down to the
kitchen and give him some bread and
milk? And the Blue Ribbon Cooking
Club will please come to order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marjorie had on her “presidential
pose,” and when that was the case the
girls always became rational and quit
fooling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Hester broke in with her slow
English drawl: “Miss President, I’ve a
suggestion to make. With the exception
of Helen and myself, who were breakfasting
out, and the somewhat eccentric-looking
lady in the red scarf and her
fellow-conspirator, who breakfasted in
their room, our members have had neither
bit nor sup. I therefore propose that
Helen and I be excused from the meeting,
with the understanding that we will agree
to any decisions the rest of you may come
to, and that we go down and get breakfast
for the crowd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This speech was received with enthusiastic
clapping of hands and cries of
“Good for you!” “Go ahead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Furthermore,” Hester went on, “as it
is already half after eleven, I move we
let bygones be bygones and make this
breakfast a dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Marjorie; “go on, and
cook whatever you like, whichever way
you want to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the English sister and her chum disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, my fellow-sufferers,” said their
president, “we’ve got to have some sort
of a system. We thought it was going to
be such lots of fun to do all the work, and
already we’re sneaking out of it. Do
you want to give up the scheme and go
home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” chorused the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, here’s my plan, and any
one can improve upon it who wants to.
We’ll have three meals a day, with dinner
at noon and a supper or high tea at six
o’clock, and we’ll take turns by twos.
Two is enough to have in the kitchen at
once besides Rosie, and then, having four
pairs of people and three meals, we won’t
have to cook the same kinds of things
each time. Am I clear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clear as mud,” said Millicent; “your
plan would be lucid to a doddering idiot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s why <span class='it'>you</span> understand it so
thoroughly,” returned the president, with
a withering glance at the enchanted
princess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now Helen and Hester are getting
dinner to-day, so suppose Marguerite and
Nan take charge to-night; then Millikens
and I will get breakfast for you to-morrow
morning,—and we’ll <span class='it'>do</span> it, too,—and
Betty and Jessie can dine us, and so on
over again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All agreed that the plan was fair, and
Marguerite announced that any one who
felt at all incapable could call on her for
assistance at any time, and she would
always be glad to cook, whether it was
her turn or not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty sniffed a little, and said that if
Daisy was on time with her scheduled
performances that was all that would be
expected or required of her; at which
Marguerite looked injured, but put her
good intentions into practice at once by
running down to help Hester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The kitchen was already a scene of
action. Hester possessed administrative
power as well as executive ability, and
while she roasted the beef and made the
soup she directed her helpers, Helen and
Rosie, so that everything was going on
in the most systematic manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do let me help you!” said Marguerite.
“What are you going to have?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only know how to cook a few things,”
said Hester, “so I’m going to have those.
Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding and
browned potatoes. And I know two soups,
bean and tomato. Bean is the best, but
we didn’t have any beans, and anyway
you have to soak ’em overnight; so I’m
making the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see you make it; I love to
watch people cook. What do you do
first?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I’ve just put the tomatoes on to
heat; one apiece,—that’s nine,—cut up in
a quart of water. Then I threw in with
them a small onion cut in bits, a couple of
stalks of celery, and a little parsley. I
would put in a bay-leaf if I had it, but I
haven’t. Then a tablespoonful of sugar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sugar in soup! I never heard of such
a thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, in tomato soup; and then a
little pepper and a teaspoonful of salt.
Now while that’s cooking I put a large
tablespoonful of butter in this tiny spider.
It melts quickly, and then I stir in a tablespoonful
of flour. You see it’s a thin,
smooth paste. Now the tomatoes are
boiling, so I turn it in and stir while it
thickens. Have you the colander ready,
Rosie? Now I strain it all through the
colander into this big bowl, and then turn
it back again into the kettle, and set it on
the back of the range until we want to
use it. Now that’s done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it’s beautiful, too,” commented
Marguerite. “I say, Hester, let’s have
a salad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Hester, decidedly; “I can’t
make salad dressing, and I’m running
this dinner myself. You can have salad
when it’s your turn. If you want to
help, go and set the table.” Hester’s
manner was brusque and very matter-of-fact;
but she meant no offense, and Marguerite
knew it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Rosie,” cried the merry
Matron; “I’ll show you how to set the
table. Goodness! Millicent, what <span class='it'>are</span>
you doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Millicent, evidently freed from her enchantment,
stood on the dining-table with
a kerosene-can in one hand and a lamp-chimney
in the other. The lamp-shade
was on her head, and she was with difficulty
holding the swing-lamp still while
she filled it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you take the lamp
down?” began Marguerite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s Lamplighter of this establishment,
I’d like to know! This is the
only correct and elegant way to fill a
swing-lamp. It is a patented way, and
recommended by all the crowned heads
of Europe, of which I am one. Now,
you see, I set down my can, then my
chimney, replace the shade—and there
you are!” And Millicent sprang off the
table and betook herself and her can to
the Grotto.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, there’s kerosene all over the
table—shall I scrub it, miss?” said Rosie,
anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said the Matron; “just wipe it
off with a dry cloth. Now lay the felt
and then the table-cloth—so; no, wait,
Rosie, get it perfectly straight; <span class='it'>almost</span>
straight is crooked, you know. There,
that will do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite arranged an embroidered
centerpiece in place just as Helen came
in with a dish of fruit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is our dessert,” she announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='i123'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i123.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0009' style='width:75%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“ ‘THIS IS THE ONLY CORRECT AND ELEGANT WAY TO FILL A SWING-LAMP.’ ”</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Set it right here,” said Marguerite;
“just the thing for the center of the table.
Now, Helen, you finish showing Rosie how
to set the table, will you? I promised to
help Hester make the Yorkshire pudding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the pudding was already made and
browning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I wanted to see you do it,” said
the aggrieved Marguerite; “what did you
put in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s awfully easy,” said Hester, “and
yet so few people make it right. I just
took a quart of milk—no, I only took
part of it at first. Well, first of all I beat
two eggs very light, and added a teaspoonful
of salt and two tablespoonfuls
of flour and about a third of the quart of
milk. Then I beat all that to a nice,
smooth batter, and added the rest of the
milk. Then I turned it into a boiling-hot
baking-pan with about three tablespoonfuls
of nice beef dripping, and gravy from
the roasting joint; now it is nearly cooked,
so I add a little more gravy from the
joint-pan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your expressions are so funny, Hester;
I never heard of a ‘joint-pan’ before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what do you call it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know; meat-pan, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Betty invaded the kitchen, and
peeped into the soup-kettle, remarking:
“I don’t think there’s very much there;
I could eat all that myself. What else is
there, Hester?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hester’s menu seemed small to hungry
Betty, and she said so; and Marguerite
observed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I offered to make a salad, but Hester
said no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll do it, all the same,” said Betty.
“Hester may rule Britannia if she wants
to, but she can’t rule Hilarity Hall. Come
on, Daisy; let’s mutiny. As Peeler-in-Chief
I’ll peel some tomatoes, and you
stir up a mayonnaise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Marguerite; “or rather,
as Hester is managing this dinner, she can
stir while I dump in the things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite was “great on mayonnaise,”
and she broke two eggs, daintily separating
the whites and yolks, and put the latter
in a soup-plate, stirring them round and
round with a silver fork. Then she added
oil, drop by drop at first, and then a trifle
faster as the dressing began to thicken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, Hester; it’s all nonsense to say
you can’t do this, and you Stoker! Come
and stir it while I hunt up some more
ingrejents.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Hester stirred away briskly but
evenly, and added oil, while Marguerite
dropped in a tablespoonful of vinegar at
intervals. Then she flirted in a dash of
Cayenne and sprinkled in a teaspoonful
of salt, and then, taking the dish into her
own hands, gave it a final whisk or two
and declared it completed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty had her tomatoes pared carefully
and cored with an apple-corer; then Marguerite
arranged them each on a few crisp
lettuce-leaves, and filled the centers with
her dressing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now all was ready, and Betty announced
dinner by sounding a bicycle-bell.
There was no table-bell to be found, so
she blocked her bicycle beside her chair,
and explained to Rosie that she must
answer the summons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls came flying to their places at
table with the alacrity of horses in a well-ordered
fire department, and Timmy Loo
was so excited that he jumped up into
Marjorie’s chair without realizing what
he was doing. The Duchess brushed him
out with scant ceremony, giving him a
cracker to console himself with; but Tim
spurned this, and sat up begging for
sugar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosie proved to be a deft waitress, and
she brought in the soup and placed it
before Marguerite, who presided very
prettily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a hungry howl rent the air as the
cover was removed, for certainly the soup
looked very scant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind,” said the tactful Matron.
“We’ll divide it evenly, and we have
several other courses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fish?” asked Jessie, hopefully, for
she was fond of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Hester, feeling as if she
had defrauded the girls somehow; “but
there’s a beautiful salad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hester’s self-respect returned, however,
with the next course, for the Yorkshire
pudding was pronounced wonderful, and
the roast was tender and beautifully
cooked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t seem a very big roast for
two dollars and ten cents, does it?” said
Marguerite, thinking of her accounts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be prosaic, Daisy,” said Nan;
“never count the cost during the feast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the salad was brought, and was
enjoyed and much complimented; and
then the great dish of fruit was passed
around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t make any pastry,” said
Hester, apologetically; “for I had no
time, and I thought the ripe fruit would
do as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed,” said Marjorie, “I love
pears. Ow!” And simultaneously Betty
made a wry face and left the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What <span class='it'>is</span> the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ugh! the fruit is all kerosene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The luckless Lamplighter looked up at
the swing-lamp, and, sure enough, it was
still dripping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must have put in too much oil,” she
said calmly, scrutinizing it with interest,
“and it—it overflew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think it did,” wailed Jessie,
looking at her pretty centerpiece spotted
with drops of oil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t hurt it any,” said Marguerite.
“I’ll wash it for you myself. Is
there any more fruit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there wasn’t, and the girls didn’t
care very much anyway; and leaving the
table to Rosie, they all went out on the
veranda.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1.1em;'>THE INDIAN CALLER</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE veranda at Hilarity Hall was a
most attractive place. Hammocks,
rockers, and wicker settees abounded,
and pillows were as sands of the sea-shore
for multitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marjorie threw herself into a hammock,
and declared that she should just stay
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Matron settled her small person in
the biggest rocking-chair, and, with an
air of weighty responsibility, frowned over
her account-books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan appropriated a wicker couch, and
announced that she was going to dream
dreams and see visions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty and Jessie sat together in another
hammock, swinging themselves by vigorous
kicks, which scratched much paint off
the piazza floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hester sat bolt upright in a small
straight-backed chair, and crocheted lace
from a gently bobbing spool of thread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen was trying to write a letter, but
was much hampered by Millicent’s teasing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It pleased the ingenious Lamplighter
to substitute various articles in place of
Helen’s inkstand, and that preoccupied
scribe had dipped her pen successively
into an apple, a hat, a slipper, and, finally,
into Millicent’s own curly topknot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long-suffering Helen smiled good-naturedly
at each prank, and patiently set
her inkstand in place again. So Millicent
declared it was no fun to tease her, and
transferred her attention to Timmy Loo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking a sheet of Helen’s paper, she
made a cocked hat for him, and, with a
paper-cutter for a sword, he posed successfully
as Napoleon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The applause at this performance was
so great that it caused Aunt Molly to
appear at her window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come over,” called Marjorie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yea, come, Fairy Godmother,” chimed
in Millicent; and well pleased, Aunt Molly
trotted over and joined the merry group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had a good time telling her all
about their most recent fun, for what is
nicer than a really interested listener?
Marjorie read the “Whitecap” to her,
which she declared was the work of
genius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” said the Duchess, as she
reached the end of what they had written
the night before, “here’s another page.
Who wrote it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Read it,” said Betty, and Marjorie
read:</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Who wrote it? Who wrote it?”
queried the girls in chorus; and then
each one tried to blush and pretended
to look conscious, and Hester said suddenly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, look at that queer man coming
up the road!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The queer man, who carried a large
pack on his back, came nearer, turned in
at the cottage gate, and paused at the
foot of the veranda steps. He was evidently
a foreigner, a great, gaunt creature
with a swarthy skin, coarse black
hair, and black, beady eyes. He wore a
long mantle heavy with embroidery, and
on his head was a gay-colored turban-like
arrangement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He looks like a supplement to an art
magazine,” whispered Millicent to Marjorie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has something to sell,” returned
Marjorie, and indeed he had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beautiful Oriental fabrics were quickly
spread out before the eyes of the delighted
girls. Scarfs, handkerchiefs, embroidered
jackets, and spangled sashes were shaken
out one after another by the long bony
fingers of the East Indian. He had, too,
a lot of fancy baskets and some hideous
little idols.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His talk was a queer kind of half-foreign
jargon, and he addressed himself principally
to Aunt Molly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jessie and Marguerite were so
dazzled by the glory of his wares that he
turned his attention to them as more likely
purchasers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ach, mees, ver’ fine, ver’ fine,” he
would say, clasping his not overclean
hands and rolling his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, catching up a white-and-gold
scarf, he deftly twisted it into a turban,
which he placed on Marguerite’s curly
head and then struck an attitude of mute
adoration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ver’ fine, ver’ fine,” he repeated, which
phrase seemed to be his entire stock of
English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, seeing Millicent’s eyes wander
toward the grotesque images, he picked
up a snake, which uncoiled itself in such a
realistic way that the girls squealed. This
seemed to amuse him very much, and he
began to tell a horrible snake story. Only
a few words were intelligible, but his
gestures were so dramatic that he was
easily understood, and the girls were
thrilled at the pantomimic relation of his
fearful encounter with a rattlesnake in
the wilds of his own country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prices of his goods were exorbitant,
but Aunt Molly had dealt with his kind
before, and by reason of her sagacious
hints of the girls’ limited means he was
induced to accept about half of what he
at first asked, and the bargains were
finally concluded to the satisfaction of
all concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the picturesque peddler departed
with gestures of respectful admiration
and regretful leave-taking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jessie had bought a scarf of exquisite
embroidery on pale-blue gauze, which was
very becoming to her pretty girlishness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hester and Betty bought baskets of
bright-colored sweet-grass, and Hester
put hers at once to use by dropping her
crochet work into it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Millicent bought a bolero jacket, which
she put on at once, and catching up the
red fez which was Marjorie’s purchase,
she perched it sidewise on her saucy head
and began to dance a fandango, while
Helen played a tinkling air on her banjo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was a funny old chap,” said Nan,
looking at the curious little idol she had
bought; “let’s write him up in the
‘Whitecap.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do,” said Millicent, “and I’ll draw
his portrait to illustrate it. He looked
like the Ancient Mariner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hint was enough for Nan, and
while Millicent drew a startling-looking
sketch which the girls declared was exactly
like him, the club Poet produced the</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girls,” said Hester, suddenly, “there’s
a fine light just now. I’ll take your pictures
if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This speech had seven different answers
all at once, but they were all acquiescent,
so Hester went to get her camera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But let’s go down to the beach,” she
said, returning; “it’s so much more picturesque
than the piazza.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a moment of inspiration Betty seized
the “Whitecap” and wrote a stanza:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>The Camera Fiend is abroad in the land;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Her tripod beareth she;</p>
<p class='line0'>And she lureth us all with a beckoning hand</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Toward the blue and shining sea.</p>
<p class='line0'>’Tis little we reck of the fate that impends</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;As we follow her hurrying feet,</p>
<p class='line0'>Till she catches the crowd with a kodak snap,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And the photograph is complete.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>“Of course,” said Hester, after they had
laughed at Betty’s effort, “I can’t be in
the picture, because I’ll have to take it,
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='i143'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>TIMMY LOO.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, then it’s no fun if we can’t have
the eight together,” said Helen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me snap it off,” said Aunt Molly,
kindly. “I don’t know anything about
a camera, but couldn’t you show me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed,” said Hester; “that will
be jolly of you—and I’ll take your picture
afterward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they all went down to the beach,
and pictures were taken of most fantastic
groups and duets and solitaires, as Millicent
called them. Last but not least,
they took a very fine solitaire of Timmy
Loo in one of his fits of good behavior,
and then Hester declared she must save
the rest of her plates for another day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know,” said Nan, in her slow,
dreamy way, “if Marguerite and I are to
get supper to-night, I really believe it’s
time we began to think about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do something more than think
about it,” groaned Betty. “I’m as
hungry as if I hadn’t attended that
grand and elegant dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you, dear?” said Marguerite,
with mock-solicitude. “Well, you shall
soon be fed. Come on, Nan; the path of
glory leads up to our cottage, and we
must tread it like the brave heroes that
we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When may we hope supper will be
ready?” called out Jessie, as the Matron
and the Poet wandered off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Twill be served at six-thirty precisely,”
replied Marguerite, with one of
her unsuccessful attempts at a dignified
mien. “Brush your hair and put on clean
pinafores, and be prompt when the bell
rings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, aye,” called out Hester; and the
group on the beach watched the departing
pair, and chuckled as they wondered
what the two rattlepates would give
them to eat.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1.1em;'>FRITTERS AND SALAD</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>‟W</span>HAT <span class='it'>are</span> we going to have for
supper, Daisy?” asked Nan, as,
arm in arm, they sauntered toward the
cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, I’m sure; but, Nannie,
just look at those clouds,—those gorgeous
ones behind that clump of pine-trees,—all
gold and pink, pushing
themselves through the green.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they are beautiful. The sun
never sets like that at home, does it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Oh, here’s the vegetable-man’s
cart. Wonder what he’s around so late
for? But suppose we get some of his
things, ’cause I know there’s nothing in
the house to cook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; let’s give them a vegetable supper.
They ought to have a light meal
after that hearty dinner. What shall we
buy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever he has the freshest,” replied
Marguerite, with one of her wisest
nods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good afternoon, young ladies,” called
out the huckster, reining up his horse.
“What’ll ye hev in my line?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you any very nice asparagus?”
asked Marguerite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grass? No mum; it’s a leetle late fer
grass. Nice egg-plants now, or cauliflower.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, cauliflower!” cried Nan. “That
will be fine—you can make a salad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I can,” said Marguerite; “and
here’s lovely-looking corn. You make
some of your delicious corn fritters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” said Nan; “and let’s buy a
watermelon, and then, with bread and butter
and coffee, that will be enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems’s if we ought to have a made
dessert,” said Marguerite, as they followed
the huckster’s slowly moving
vehicle to the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll make a snow pudding,” said Nan.
“Let’s give them a real bang-up supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Marguerite; and the
two fell to work with such vigor that
Rosie stared at them in astonishment, for
she had secretly thought this particular
duet ornamental rather than useful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fly round, Rosie,” said Marguerite
to the smiling Irish girl. “Husk this
corn, please, and cut it carefully from the
ears—we want to make fritters. Perhaps
you’d better grate it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, cut it,” said Nan; “it’s so young
and tender.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, cut it, Rosie,” went on the Matron;
“and then boil the cauliflower for
twenty minutes in salted water—oh,
you’d better do that before you fix the
corn, so it can get ice-cold for the salad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Rosie,” put in Nan, “first I wish
you’d get out the eggs for me; and just
open this box of gelatine and put it to
soak in cold water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There ain’t no eggs, miss,” announced
Rosie, after a search in the cupboard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what a shame! I’ve set my
heart on making a snow pudding. Well,
Rosie, can’t you run over to the grocer’s
and get some? It won’t take a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m,” said the willing maid, and
away she went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear!” groaned Marguerite, “she
didn’t put the cauliflower on to cook;
she might have done that before she
started.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do it,” said Nan. “Is it that it
must be washed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course; oh—no—I don’t
know,” replied Marguerite, somewhat
vaguely. “Does it look soiled?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much,” said Nan, cheerfully;
“just a few stains of good old Mother
Earth on its fair face. That won’t hurt
anybody—so here goes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dropped the cauliflower into a kettle
of water and set it on the stove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have everything served separately,”
said the canny Marguerite, “and
then it will seem like more. Somehow I
don’t see much around to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, there’s plenty,” said Nan, who
was weighing sugar. “Corn fritters are
hearty, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosie soon returned with the eggs, and
the preparations went merrily on. Nan
sang and Marguerite whistled, and occasionally
they bumped against each other,
and then waltzed a few turns around the
kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Rosie, supply me with oil and
vinegar and salt and pepper, and I’ll
whisk up this mayonnaise in a jiffy.
Phew! what’s burning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the cauliflower, but luckily it
was only scorched on one side. Marguerite
pared off the brown part, pronounced
it done, and set it aside to cool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t speak to me,” cried Nan, who
was wildly manipulating a Dover beater;
“this snow pudding won’t snow; it never
will when I’m in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, deary; it will be just as
good soft.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t,” wailed Nan; “and Betty
will make fun of it—hers are always
perfect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re perfect, so who cares
about a pudding more or less? But
jiminetty! when are you going to make
the corn fritters? The girls will be here
in a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can make corn fritters, miss. Shall
I be afther doin’ ’em?” said Rosie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do,” cried Nan, still beating away
for dear life; “and get the frying-pan on
the stove—it wants to be awfully hot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, somehow, the things got
done: the snow pudding was <span class='it'>nearly</span> a
success; the cauliflower salad looked fine;
and as for Rosie’s corn fritters, they were
of a melting golden brown that appealed
very strongly to the two hungry cooks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many are there, Rosie?” asked
Nan, eyeing the pile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thirteen, miss; the corn wouldn’t
make no more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thirteen! An unlucky number!” exclaimed
Marguerite. “Nannie, let’s eat
one, and offer our friends a decent
dozen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Nan, and a fritter
was carefully halved and eaten with a
relish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those are simply great!” said Marguerite,
with a hungry glance at the
heaped-up plate. “You like them, don’t
you, Rosie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ma’am; I never touches corn in
any way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t! Now see here, Nan; we
would, of course, have left two for Rosie,
and since she doesn’t care for them, and
the girls haven’t come yet, let’s you and
I eat Rosie’s share now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan willingly agreed, and the plate
was further depleted by two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still the girls came not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s ridiculous,” said Nan, in a hesitating
way, “to serve ten fritters to eight
people. One apiece seems so much more
reasonable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does,” said Marguerite, solemnly
nodding her pretty head. “Let us so
arrange matters that eight shall be
served.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon the cooks appropriated one
more fritter apiece, and declared that they
really increased in deliciousness. Then
they sat and wondered why the girls
didn’t come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s just half-past,” said Nan; “I
supposed they’d be here howling before
this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know,” said Marguerite, “I
don’t feel like waiting, and I don’t believe
they’d care if we—you and I, I mean—ate
our two fritters now. They’re so
much better hot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll do it,” said Nan; “two of them
are ours, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So two more of Rosie’s fritters had just
disappeared when a barking announced
the approach of the cavalcade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Supper ready?” cried Betty, as they
all trooped in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Marguerite, beaming with
pride at her ability to answer the question
in the affirmative; “bring it in,
Rosie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls seated themselves at table,
and Timmy Loo waltzed gaily about in
great expectation when Rosie brought in
the plate of six corn fritters and passed it
round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how good!” cried Marjorie, helping
herself. “I just love these things,
and it’s so nice of you not to bake them
all at once. They’re lovely just off the
pan. Hurry up the next lot, Rosie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan blushed and thought seriously of
slipping under the table; but Marguerite
said blandly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, these are individual fritters.
There’s only one apiece, and Nan and I
ate ours before you came home. What
made you so late?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only one apiece!” exclaimed Betty,
ignoring Marguerite’s question. “Why,
I could eat six!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So could I,” said Millicent; but Marguerite
went on airily:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh! do you think we’re going to
have nothing else? There are several
courses yet to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This mollified the girls, and each ate
her fritter hopefully, while Nan and Marguerite
chattered very fast to hide their
rapidly growing embarrassment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next course was the salad, though
it did seem as if something else ought to
have preceded it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m!” said Marjorie, as the not over-bounteous-looking
bowl was placed before
her. “I see the salads are also to
be served individually. Mine looks very
nice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no!” cried Nan; but Marguerite
laughed gaily and said: “Why, you girls
would ruin a hotel proprietor. How <span class='it'>can</span>
you want so much to eat? No, madam;
we offer you a variety in our service.
The salad is to be served at table.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then Rosie brought eight plates,
and by careful division the Duchess portioned
to each about a tablespoonful of
salad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s really plenty of it, after all,”
said Betty, laying down her fork after the
first taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” said Marguerite, hurriedly
trying hers. “Oh, it’s scorched, isn’t it?
Well, you see, it burned a little while it
was cooking, but I thought we scraped
the burnt part all off. Queer how that
scorchy taste permeates the whole thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it away, Rosie,” said Marjorie;
“remove the smoked salad and delight
our eyes with the next course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next delicacy seemed to be a great
bowl of yellow custard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dessert already?” said Jessie. “Oh,
perhaps we’re having one of those backward
dinners. I’ve read about them.
You begin with coffee and end with soup,
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love custard,” said Millicent.
“What do we eat it on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s—it’s a snow pudding,” faltered
Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, so it is,” cried Millicent, “and the
snow has all melted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s down underneath,” Nan
went on hopefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it must be,” replied teasing
Millicent. “Get the snow-shovel; perhaps
we can dig it up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, the dessert was all eaten, for
a snow pudding tastes good even when
its shape is not all that could be desired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, something else?” cried Millicent,
as Rosie appeared with a pile of
fresh plates. “You astonish me! Girls,
you really oughtn’t to overfeed us in this
mad fashion. A watermelon, as I live!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great green melon was hailed with
delight by all, and, except that it was a
bit warmish from having traveled about
in the sun all day, it was pronounced extremely
satisfactory. Coffee followed,
and Betty remarked that that made up in
quality and quantity for what the other
courses had lacked in both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of the things <span class='it'>didn’t</span> turn out
quite right,” admitted Marguerite, “but
you had quite enough of them. You
can’t expect the lavishness of a Nero on
five dollars a week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go in the Grotto and write in
the ‘Whitecap,’ ” said Helen, who always
interposed when Betty and Marguerite
began a discussion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So into the Grotto they went, and while
Helen picked at her banjo, and Nan and
Jessie sang, the others made up rhymes
for their book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some struggles, in which Marguerite
joined with as much good will as
the others, they produced this masterpiece,
which they read aloud to the musicians,
who applauded most heartily:</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>‟M</span>Y hearers,” said Nan, as they all
dawdled on the veranda one morning,
“a truly magnificent scheme is forming
itself in my fertile brain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray expound and elucidate,” murmured
Marguerite, from the hammock,
where she was lazily swaying to and fro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s nothing much,” said Nan;
“only that we give a play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that all?” said Marguerite. “I
thought you meant something nice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s do it,” cried Betty. “I just
love that sort of thing—‘Oh, Romeo,
Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we hire the town hall, or wouldn’t
that be big enough?” inquired Helen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And don’t let’s do it half-way,” said
Marjorie. “We can get scenery and costumes
from New York and give ‘L’Aiglon’
or ‘Faust’ or something worth while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense!” said Nan. “Do be quiet,
girls, until I tell you what I mean. You
see, we’ve written such really good and
funny things in the ‘Whitecap’ that
I’m sure we could write a little play,
with songs and things, and then act it;
and it would be lots of fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you mean an opera,” said Millicent.
“Why, of course we could dash
off an opera any morning, just as easy as
not. Come on; let’s begin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, wait!” cried Nan; “you don’t
understand, and I won’t be made fun of.
I’m serious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you are; no one took you

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>O</span>NCE started, the play monopolized
all the interest and attention of
the club.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Molly was called over and the
great project was laid before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it will be lovely, girlies,” she
said. “What can I do to help?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We need sympathy and advice,” said
Marjorie, with the judicial air that marked
the Duchess’s serious moments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll give you those,” said Aunt
Molly, “but I want to be of more material
help. Suppose I provide you with an
audience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, do,” cried Betty. “Ask the Marlowes
and the Hillises, and those nice
people who live the other side of your
house—I forget their name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we can’t sing this foolishness
we’ve written to a lot of strangers,”
said Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed we can,” responded Marguerite.
“The Blue Ribbon Club can do anything,
if it makes up its mind to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The music would be prettier if we
had some men’s voices in it,” said Nan,
who was looking over the written sheets.
“It’s all so high and light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Ned sings a fine barytone,”
said Marjorie. “Do you suppose he’d
help us out, aunty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course he would,” answered Aunt
Molly, heartily; “he’d do anything in his
power for the ‘lambs,’ as he always
calls you girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s write a part for him, then,”
said Hester. “What could he be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the plot of your play?” asked
Aunt Molly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls looked at each other blankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it hasn’t any plot,” said Nan.
“Do plays always have to have plots?
You see, we’ve just written songs for
each of us in the characters we’ve assumed
down here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I don’t exactly see how Uncle
Ned could be brought in,” said Aunt
Molly, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can’t be <span class='it'>brought</span> in; he’ll just have
to <span class='it'>come</span> in,” said Betty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like a burglar,” said Nan; “we’ve
expected one ever since we’ve been here,
and we may as well have our expectations
realized.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not a bad idea,” said Hester.
“The play, of course, will represent all us
girls here in this cottage; and Uncle Ned
might appear as a burglar—a nice, kind
one, you know, like ‘Editha’s Burglar.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and he can be real affable and
social, and sing solos as he prowls about
for his plunder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That seems more like a plot. Let’s
do it,” said Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out came the paper-pad and pencils,
and genius was set to burning, all of
which resulted in several songs for Uncle
Ned, whose consent to the plan was fully
guaranteed by Aunt Molly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Amiable Burglar was destined to
enter through a window while singing
this solo to the tune of “Robin Adair”:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those are beautiful verses,” said Aunt
Molly, who knew as much about poetry as
a hoptoad, “and Uncle Ned will be perfectly
delighted to sing them. When do
your rehearsals begin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-night,” said Marjorie, growing
presidential of aspect. “Look here, girls,
if this thing is going to be at all, it’s going
to be a success with a big S. You
hear me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do!” shouted the other seven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then listen further. There’s no use
of our all fussing with these verses, for
Hester and Nan are quite capable of making
them up alone. So let them finish the
libretto of the play, as they call it. <span class='it'>I</span> call
it an operetta. Now for stage-manager
I appoint Betty, and she can get any one
to help her who will, but they must attend
entirely to staging the whole thing—look
out for scenery, lights, and all that. The
costumes I put in the capable hands of
Marguerite and Jessie, who know more
about clothes in a minute than the rest
of us in a thousand years. Helen, of
course, is the orchestra; if she can get
any one to help her, so much the better.
Millicent and I will look after the supper;
for I’m sure you’ll need one after this
wonderful performance, to say nothing of
the audience, who, I feel sure, will be
utterly exhausted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bravo, Marjorie!” cried Aunt Molly.
“You’re a manager, and no mistake.
Now I’ll help any one or all of these
committees. Call on me for anything,
and you’ll find me willing if not always
capable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hooray for Aunt Molly!” cried Marjorie,
and all responded with a will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Marguerite and Jessie put their
pretty heads together and planned costumes
for the young actresses that were
to be dreams of beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how can we get all this tarlatan
and stuff?” said Marguerite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll run up to New York,” said Jessie.
“I can go in the morning and be back by
six o’clock; and you know the success of
this thing depends as much on the costume
effects as on the music.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty announced that her committee of
stage-managers would be increased by the
addition of Aunt Molly and Uncle Ned;
and this proved a wise arrangement, for
it insured attractive stage-settings and
a curtain and footlights that worked
beautifully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hester and Nan, feeling the burden of
the libretto heavy upon them, went to
work and soon achieved a jolly duet for
Marguerite and Uncle Ned, whose voices
were most harmonious. The air was
from the “Mikado,” and the words were
these:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1.1em;'>A SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE great day drew near. The play
was to be presented on Friday evening,
and much was to be done by way
of preparation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Ned and two carpenters were
building a stage in the parlor, which,
though small, was a jolly little affair;
and Aunt Molly, who was a bit of an
artist, was painting some crude but
effective scenery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty was supposed to be helping Uncle
Ned, and Marjorie and Millicent were trying
to help the scenic artist; but if their
assistance wasn’t very valuable, they at
least knew enough not to hinder the head
workers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jessie and Marguerite were devising
stunning costumes and strange-looking
“properties,” the use of which no one
could guess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These two modistes were continually
making pilgrimages to the shops of Long
Beach; which emporiums never, by any
chance, yielded up the materials the anxious
maidens were in search of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going to the store again?” said Marjorie,
as Marguerite flew by her with an
anxious face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; we <span class='it'>must</span> have some red stuff, if
I have to use paper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take Timmy Loo, won’t you? He
hasn’t had a run to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Course I will. Come on, Tim.” And
the Chaperon flew away, followed by the
silver-blue Skye. After an hour or more
the yellow-haired Chaperon returned in a
state of exhaustion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll <span class='it'>never</span> take that dog out with me
again,” she declared, with such a tragic
air that Marjorie felt certain her pet must
have brought disgrace upon the whole
club.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what has my bad little bundle
of a dog been a-doing?” she inquired,
grabbing up the quivering bunch of silver
curls and blue ribbon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wasn’t bad,” said Marguerite,
laughing, “but he’s such a nuisance. I
thought I should never get home. He
made me go into every shop in the
village.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That didn’t take <span class='it'>very</span> long,” observed
Betty, dryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but he insisted on being fed at
each place; and he knows exactly where
they all keep their eatables. At the grocer’s
he flew to the glass case where the
chocolates are, and pawed at it and
whined until Mr. Forbes had to open it
and give him some. Then at the milliner’s,
where I was buying ribbon, he tore
out into her back parlor, and jumped up
on a table, trying to reach a little chest of
drawers where, it seems, she keeps sugar-lumps.
And even at the dry-goods shop
he dived behind a lot of rolls of stuff and
found a paper bag of ginger cookies.
Oh, he’s a terror! How does he know
all these places?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He smells them out!” said Marjorie,
patting Tim’s head, while the dog, understanding
that he was being praised,
wagged his bit of a tail and blinked his
eyes proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when he had found the things,”
continued Marguerite, “he never offered
to touch them, but just sat up and begged,
with that cocky blue bow sticking up behind,
and of course nobody could refuse
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think not!” cried Marjorie,
hugging her treasure. “Of course nobody
could refuse a bit of chocolate or
sugar to such a polite, refined, well-bred
little doggikins, who <span class='it'>always</span> keeps his
bow at the back of his neck!” And Tim
fairly glowed at her fond appreciation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although for several days Hilarity Hall
was in a most chaotic state of preparation,
and although it seemed as if order never
could come of it, yet on Friday evening
at seven o’clock everything was in complete
readiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen’s banjo music was augmented by
the two Hillis boys, Frank and Raymond,
one of whom played the banjo and the
other the mandolin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were nice boys, and when Aunt
Molly invited them to play for the Hilarity
Hall girls they were more than pleased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls liked it too, especially Marguerite
and Jessie, who immediately assumed
the coy and bewitching airs which
they thought the occasion demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why so many chairs?” asked Marjorie,
as Uncle Ned brought over more
and more from his own cottage, and Aunt
Molly placed them in compact rows in
the parlor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t ask questions, miss,” said her
uncle. “You left the invitation of an
audience to your charming and capable
aunt, and now ’tis yours not to make
reply, yours not to wonder why, but run
along and don that fetching costume in
which you’re to dazzle the eyes of this
large and imposing audience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Imposed-on audience you mean, Uncle
Ned,” said Marjorie, as she danced away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Blue Ribbon Club had a uniform,
which they had concluded to wear in their
play. It was a plain gown of soft light-gray
material, with a ruffled white muslin
kerchief. A picturesque effect was
gained by a hooded cape of the gray lined
with pink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite declared that Aunt Molly
was an honorary member of the club, and
she must have a uniform too. So one was
made for her, and the nine ladies made a
pretty picture in the nun-like garb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last all was in readiness, and the
audience was beginning to arrive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From behind the curtain the girls could
hear the rustling of the programs and
hearty laughter from the appreciative
readers. The programs were the work
of Betty and Hester, and were declared
by all to be a triumph of genius.</p>

<p class='noindent'>As the curtain began to rise, the audience
gave way to wild and enthusiastic
applause, more boisterous indeed than
might have been expected from the sedate
and decorous friends whom Aunt Molly
had invited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the curtain was not fairly up before
the flustered girls on the stage perceived
the reason of this outburst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The front row of chairs was entirely
occupied by the Middleton boys whose
presence they had so insistently forbidden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were Marjorie’s two brothers,
and Nan’s one; there were the Burleigh
boys, Ted Lewis, Dick Morton, and Roger
Hale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With faces on a broad grin, they proceeded
to make both manual and vociferous
protestations of delight until the
opening chorus began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this did not entirely silence the
happy ones in the front row. No; the
airs of the operetta being familiar to them,
the boys joined their strong young voices
to those of the prima donnas on the stage,
and the result was truly fine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The play went on beautifully. Marguerite
looked so pretty and sang so well
that she, perhaps, received the most applause
among the girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Uncle Ned was so funny as the
Amiable Burglar, and introduced such
funny jokes and antics into his part, that
he was by all odds the star of the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty forgot her part several times, but,
being quick-witted, she extemporized bits
that were better than her original lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen proved to be the best actress, and
her sleep-walking scene was so effective
that she was advised to study for <span class='it'>Lady

<p class='pindent'>Jessie was stage-struck. Her round,
rosy little face grew pale, her blue eyes
stared, and her voice failed her entirely.
Less embarrassed than dazed, she walked
to a chair at one end of the stage, and
sat down, calmly folding her arms. This
delighted the audience, who greatly applauded
the bewildered actress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the second act the girls all wore
frilled white tarlatan dresses, with sashes
and bows of pale green ribbon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scene was a flowery garden, and it
was most attractive, with a rose hedge at
the back, and palms and flowering bushes
all about. To be sure, the roses were
made of pink tissue-paper, but they were
very effective, and the group of lovely
girls were slowly waving feather fans in
time to a slow, soft</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” cried the boys, in concert, as the
chorus concluded. “Ah, ah, ah!” But
though they were in a teasing mood, they
were careful not to disturb the play seriously,
and the merry farce came successfully
to a finish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the boys’ merriment broke loose.
They swarmed up on to the stage; they
kissed the girls who were their sisters or
cousins, and shook hands vigorously with
those who were not. They greeted Uncle
Ned and Aunt Molly effusively; for was
it not owing to them that this joyful treat
was brought about? Indeed, you never
saw such gay, irrepressible spirits as
those Middleton guests were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they adjourned to the dining-room
the Feast Committee found that their provision
had been amply supplemented,
and the rose-garlanded, tarlatan-frocked
ladies found that histrionic laurels in no
way affected their appetites.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When did you come?” asked Marjorie
of Jack Kellogg. “You know I told
you you positively couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marjorie had on her Duchess air, but
Jack, being a brave youth, was not afraid
of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” he replied; “but your Aunt
Molly said we positively could, and so
we’re here, and—what do you think of
this? We’re staying at the Long Beach
Inn, and we’re not going home until to-morrow
night!”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1.1em;'>THE BOYS’ ENTERTAINMENT</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>‟W</span>ELL,” said Marjorie, “I suppose
we’ve got those boys on our hands
for this whole day”; and the Duchess’s
pretty brow wrinkled as if with the cares
of a nation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the morning after the play, and
the house was in a state of “chaos and old
night,” as Betty expressed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad of it,” said Marguerite,
frankly. “I think we’ll have lots of
fun, and there are so many things we
can do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can clear up this house, for one,”
said Hester, looking dubiously at the
wreck of scenery and properties scattered
all about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s make the boys clear it up,”
suggested Betty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good for you!” cried Jessie. “You
<span class='it'>do</span> have brilliant ideas sometimes, don’t
you, Betsy? Those scapegraces have
imposed themselves upon us, and they
may as well be put to use.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are they? I don’t see them,”
said Nan, peering under the tables and
chairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they’ll be here soon enough;
don’t worry,” said Millicent, who was
calmly eating a late breakfast. “They
are but henchmen; let us command them.
They should be only too glad to do our
bidding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very soon after, with a wild war-whoop,
the boys appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a lazy lot!” they cried, looking
at the table. “Why, we had breakfast
hours ago, and we’ve had a swim and a
run, and we’ve called on Aunt Molly,
and—oh, I say, give us some jam?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not until you work for it,” said Millicent,
putting the jam-jar in the cupboard
and standing in front of the closed door.
“You see the disarray of our household
gods. Well, restore this palace to its
original exquisite tidiness and order, and
you shall have—a spoonful of jam apiece.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A spoonful!” cried Harry Bond. “A
jarful, you mean! But come on, fellows;
let’s fire out this trash.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were ten boys, for the eight who
came down from Middleton had promptly
annexed the two Hillis boys; and the
rapidity with which Hilarity Hall was put
in order was suggestive of a Western
cyclone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You girls vamoose,” shouted Roger
Hale. “Run upstairs, or outdoors, or
across the street, or somewhere, and
quick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Blue Ribbon Club as one girl flew
upstairs, and proceeded to dictate orders
over the banister, which, however, were
unheeded and even unheard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timmy Loo danced frantically about
among the marauding boys until he was
unceremoniously swept out of the front
door by Roger’s broom. He was rescued
by Rosie, who, much astounded at the
turn things had taken, ran over to Aunt
Molly’s for shelter and safety. But soon
the squall was over and calm reigned
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come down, girls,” called Ted Lewis.
“One free, all free!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down came the club, bright and smiling,
with fresh shirt-waists and the additional
ribbons or trinkets that masculine
presence always seems to necessitate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, milady,” said Harry Bond to
Millicent, “your palace is restored to all
its pristine glory, and now fork over that
jam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the jam and everything else the
larder contained was set forth, and those
voracious boys speedily despatched it
all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said Harry Bond, “we’re all
going down to the beach to take pictures
and otherwise enjoy ourselves this pleasant
morning; and then, since you urge us
so, we’re all coming back here to dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do,” said Marjorie, heartily; “that
will be lots of fun.” And all the other
girls echoed her opinion, except Marguerite
and Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you <span class='it'>can’t</span>!” exclaimed the embarrassed
Matron. “You see, it’s Nannie’s
and my turn to get dinner to-day, and
there isn’t half enough in the house for
such a horde of pirates, and—and we’d
have to stay home all the morning to get
ready for you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite looked the picture of distress
at the thought of missing the fun
on the beach, and Nan looked placidly
indifferent, but had no appearance of
intending to be left behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll take the ‘Whitecap’ to the
beach with us,” she said, as she put on
her hat, “and the boys can draw pictures
in it. Jack’s quite clever at catching a
likeness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But <span class='it'>what</span> about dinner?” said Marguerite,
piteously, her responsibilities as
Chaperon suddenly beginning to weigh
upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right, Daisy,” said Tom
Burleigh, who had been holding a whispered
but emphatic conversation with
Harry Bond. “We realize the unexpectedness
of this visitation, and ’tis but
natural that you girls should find yourselves
unable to cope with it—whereupon
and therefore and for which reason
we beg to inform you that we will get the
dinner ourselves, and all we ask of you,
fair ladies, is your gracious company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a flourish and a grand bow, Tom
completed his speech and awaited a reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t seem quite right,” said
Marguerite; but Betty said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, bother! of course it’s all right.
It’ll do you boys good to do a little
work, and I, for one, accept your invitation
with delight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me, too!” shouted all the other girls,
and Marjorie inquired where the dinner
would be served.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Hilarity Hall, of course,” said
Tom. “But don’t ask questions, miss.
When you’re invited out you mustn’t
be rude.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we’ll invite the kind lady and
gentleman next door,” put in Roger, “for
’tis to them we owe this trip, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Ned and Aunt Molly were
pleased to accept the invitation which
was duly offered them; and then, after a
few mysterious confabs with Rosie, the
boys declared they were at the young
ladies’ services, and all ran down to the
beach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stayed until noon, when Tom
Burleigh, who announced himself as
Master of Ceremonies, ordered the whole
crowd back to the cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, ladies,” he said, as they arrived,
“every one of you fly upstairs to your
rooms, and occupy yourselves with sewing
dolls’ rags, or knitting aprons, or
whatever pastime pleases you. Take
beauty-naps if you like, but don’t dare to
appear on the first floor of this cottage
until summoned by the dinner-horn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite and Jessie wanted to stay
and help the new cooks, but it was not
allowed; so upstairs the girls trooped, and
Ted Lewis tied rope barriers across the
staircase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those ridiculous boys!” said Marjorie,
as the girls congregated in her room.
“They won’t have half enough plates or
forks or anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they will,” said Betty, confidently;
“they’ll have everything ship-shape;
don’t you worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the noise, I should think they
were building a house,” said Nan; and,
sure enough, hammering and pounding
was going on below, as well as the clattering
of dishes and much scurrying to
and fro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course the girls looked out of the
windows, and they saw Rosie and some
of the boys bringing piles of plates and
cups from Aunt Molly’s; but as that
lady herself did not appear, they guessed
she, too, had been forbidden to assist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After an hour or more of impatient excitement
on the part of the girls, Rosie
came up to them, broadly smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The young gintlemin bid me say that
dinner is about to be served, and w’u’d
yez please come down to the parlor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the girls trooped down, and found
Uncle Ned and Aunt Molly awaiting
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the boys appeared, and, with obsequious
demonstrations of greeting and
compliment, they invited their guests to
the dining-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys all wore aprons, having confiscated,
with Rosie’s help, all those belonging
to the club.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Big Tom Burleigh looked especially
funny in a lacy, frilly little affair of
Jessie’s, and as there had not been quite
enough to go round, Harry Bond had
made a big pinafore of newspapers. Then
some of the boys had found time to make
cooks’ paper caps for them all, and, with
paper roses left from the night before in
their buttonholes, their appearance was
festive indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dining-room was a sight to behold.
They had discarded the regular dining-table,
and built a long narrow one of the
boards of the dismantled stage. This
table, whose length was such that it required
three table-cloths, was decorated
with great bowls of paper roses; and the
whole room was decked with green
branches, palms, and paper flowers, all of
which had done duty as the garden in the
play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twenty people seated themselves at
the long and festive board, Uncle Ned and
Aunt Molly, of course, being invited to sit
at the head and foot; and then Rosie
began to serve the feast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But one waitress was far from being
enough for that hungry crowd, so the
be-aproned boys took turns in playing
waiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first course was clam chowder, of
which the Burleigh boys were justly famed
concocters. It was wonderfully good,
and as they had made a great kettleful,
there was enough and to spare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next was a course of broiled lobster.
Although the boys pretended at first that
they had cooked these, they afterward
confessed that they had ordered them sent
over from the Inn. But their guests
cared not a jot where the lobsters had met
their fiery fate, and pronounced them the
most delicious ever tasted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this came blackberry-pies, half a
dozen of them, and Aunt Molly fairly
blushed as encomiums were showered on
her contribution to the spread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The coffee was fine. Ted Lewis always
made it in camp, and being accustomed to
making large quantities, and in a big tin
pail instead of a coffee-pot, he had no
trouble in turning out a perfect concoction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crackers and a red-coated cheese made
their appearance, also a big basket of
fruit, and Uncle Ned had brought over a
box of bonbons, so the merry crowd sat
for a long time over their dessert—so
long, indeed, that the boys were obliged
to leave the table and scurry away to
catch their home-bound train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have a few dishes to wash,”
said Harry Bond, with a twinkle in his
eye. “But that’s woman’s work—a nice
housewifely occupation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they’ll be done all right,” said
his sister; “and now run, Harry, or you’ll
be late. Give lots of love to mamma and
grandma, and tell them—” But Harry was
out of sight and hearing by that time, so
Marjorie didn’t send her message.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now!” said Betty, as they turned
back to the deserted dining-room. “What
a clutteration! But I s’pose if ’twere
done when ’tis done, ’twere well ’twere
done quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Hester the practical; “let’s
fly at it and clear everything up, and
then sit out on the veranda and talk it
all over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Molly and Uncle Ned were politely
invited to go home, and then the
many hands went at the work, and it was
accomplished with surprising quickness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the Blue Ribbon Club grouped
itself on the veranda, and if those eight
tongues didn’t wag!</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked as an octave until bed-time,
and then, breaking up into duets,
they kept on talking until they fell asleep.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1.1em;'>HIDE-AND-SEEK</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>ND so the days danced on, each one
happier than the last, and all too
short for the amount of fun that had to
be crammed into them. Wheeling, walking,
boating, bathing, fishing, and crabbing
were favorite amusements; but best
of all the girls loved to play some rollicking,
frolicking game that called forth
peals of laughter which had no cause
save sheer gladness of living.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s play hide-and-seek,” said Betty,
one morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Jessie, loyally but
lazily. “You go and hide and cry ‘Coop!’
and we’ll all come and find you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t mean that baby way; I
mean a nice new way. I’ve invented it
myself just now, and it’s gay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elucidate further,” said Marjorie, looking
up from her work, which was the combing
of Timmy Loo’s silvery tangled curls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a gorgeous game,” went on
Betty, “but it’s not adapted to or for
dogs. If the nondescript mop in your
lap goes by that name he’ll have to be
buried before we can proceed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buried indeed! my own, my only
Timmy Loo!” cried Marjorie, caressing
the moppy mass in question. “Not that,
not that, I pray you; but, if really necessary,
I could secrete him with a kind
neighbor until your wild project has fizzled
out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, listen, then,” said Betty. “We
all hide, you know, and find each other
one by one, and then the one who stays
hidden longest gets a prize.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beautiful—beautiful,” sighed Marguerite;
“but what is the prize? Might
it be worth winning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The prize can be that photograph I
took of you girls in your bathing-suits,”
said Hester. “I’ll never be able to get
another as good, and it’s so funny it’s
worth having.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is,” cried Nan. “I’d love to
have it. But you vowed you were going
to keep it yourself, Hester.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know; but I’m so noble I offer it
freely in this noble cause. Besides, I may
win it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure enough,” cried Betty; “now let’s
begin. Dispose of Timmy Loo, Marjorie,
and then all come into the Grotto.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosie,” called Marjorie, “won’t you
please take this valuable and high-bred
morsel of caninity over to Mrs. Warburton’s?
And then you may go for a run on
the beach. ’Twill do you good, and besides
we want to use the whole of this
palatial residence for a while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosie departed, beaming as usual, and
the girls went into the parlor, and Betty
closed the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said she, “we first draw lots
for the seeker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This ceremony was gone through with,
and the lot fell upon Helen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad of it,” said she. “I’d far
rather hunt than hide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Next,” said Betty, “the rest of us
must draw these numbered papers, and—well,
draw, then I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each took a folded paper, and Millicent’s
proved to be number one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you go first,” said Betty; “we’ll
give you two minutes by Helen’s watch.
In that time you must have hidden yourself
either in this house or about its large
and spacious grounds. No fair going
off the premises.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Millicent departed on tiptoe, closing the
door after her, and Betty continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m second; so when the two minutes
are up, I go and hide, and you allow me
also two minutes in which to tuck myself
away. Then so on until all are gone but
our Helen, our pride and joy. After the
last two minutes she starts to hunt, and
the first one she finds goes with her to
hunt the others; and so on, you know,
until all are found but one, who is, of
course, the lucky owner of Hester’s masterpiece
of photographic art.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two minutes passed, and Betty went
to hide. Then the others, one by one, until
at last Helen was ready to start on her
hunting expedition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They wouldn’t be so babyish as to
hide behind doors,” she thought, as she
looked behind several. “However, it’s
best to be systematic. I’ll open every
door I see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Acting on this plan, she opened the door
of the sideboard as she passed that old-fashioned
and roomy piece of furniture,
and, to her surprise, there was the chubby
Marguerite squeezed in between two
shelves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, help me out!” she cried. “I’m
nearly dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a close fit, but Helen pulled her
out, and together they continued the
search.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some one would be sure to hide in the
kitchen,” declared the canny Matron, so
they explored the cupboards there. And,
as might have been expected, away back
behind some pots and pans was Hester,
who looked angrily at her discoverers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought I had such a good place,”
she said, crawling out. “How ever did
you find me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on,” cried Helen; “it’s getting
to be more fun; let’s find the others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s get some buns and milk first,”
said Marguerite; “I’m fearfully hungry,
and the sight of the cake-box maddens
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the three sat down to a light repast,
and as they fell to chatting they quite
forgot the game and the other players
thereof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re a nice lot!” said Marjorie,
suddenly appearing from the cellar.
“I hid in the coal-bin, and I’m sure you
never would have found me; but when I
heard you talking up here, I thought you
had found all the rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind,” said Hester; “you’re on
our side now. Come on; let’s dig up the
others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan was easily found, as she had
climbed out her bedroom window and
was calmly sitting on the roof, gazing at
the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t have hurried on my account,”
she said; “I’d just as lief sit
here all day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jessie was discovered next, standing in
a wardrobe among a lot of dresses, which
she had fondly hoped would conceal her.
And they would have done so, save that
her head showed above them, and her feet
below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the six began to hunt for Betty
and Millicent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was really a hunt, for they looked in
every likely place and a great many unlikely
ones without success. They went
downstairs and out of doors, only to return
and search from cellar to attic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last Jessie, who was peering through
the dim, dusty recesses of the low-ceiled
attic, saw an old trunk, and, throwing it
open, found Betty, cramped and aching,
but game to the last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh, the mistletoe bough. Oh, the
mistletoe bough,’ ” sang Jessie, as she
helped Betty out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I the last?” cried Betty, looking
at the girls, who came trooping up to see
her hiding-place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; Millicent is still missing,” said
Marjorie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then she gets the picture,” said Betty,
looking disappointed, “and I wanted it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, Peeler,” said Hester;
“I’ll take another for you, and it will be
just as jolly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they hunted for Millicent. But
no trace of her could be found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s been shpirited away, I’m
thinkin’,” said Rosie, who had returned
and was much startled at what she thought
an alarming disappearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s get Timmy Loo and see if he
can’t find her,” said Marjorie, after they
had called and yelled and begged Millicent
to come to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; set the bloodhound on her track,”
said Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Timmy Loo was brought home, and
each girl told him what he was to do, and
showed him Millicent’s shoes and gloves
and dresses until the poor little dog was
quite bewildered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he finally understood, and with a
bound he sprang upon Marjorie’s bed,
which, by the way, was covered with
clean shirt-waists and stiffly starched
skirts just home from the laundry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tim, get off those clothes!”
cried Marjorie; but Tim only danced
around on them and barked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he flew to the pillows, and, though
much tangled up in the frills of one of
Jessie’s clean aprons, he burrowed until
he disclosed some tangled curls and a
tortoise-shell comb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There she is!” cried Marjorie; and,
flinging back the counterpane, they saw
a flushed, rosy face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been asleep,” said Millicent, yawning
and stretching. “What do you girls
want? Oh, I was hiding, wasn’t I? Well,
I hid in such a nice place I inadvertently
took a nap, and I’ve had lovely dreams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get up,” cried Betty; “you’re spoiling
all the clean clothes, and—you’ve
won the prize.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I? Goody! And I haven’t
hurt the clothes a bit. Tim did, though,
and he woke me up jumping on me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Millicent slid out of the bed, did
up her hair, and was led downstairs in
triumph to receive her prize.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was presented by Betty, “because,”
as she said, “I came next nearest to getting
it, and so I ought to have the melancholy
pleasure of handing it over to me
hated rival.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The presentation speech, and the grandiloquent
thanks expressed by the recipient,
caused such hilarity that Aunt Molly
came running over to hear the fun. Then
they told her all about the game, and as
she was such an appreciative listener,
they told her much more, until suddenly
Betty cried out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, see that queer-looking person; I
believe she’s coming here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All looked and beheld a tall, imperious-looking
lady, garbed in eccentric fashion,
stalking toward them at a rapid gait.
Her bonnet was elaborately decked with
high feathers, which nodded and bobbed
in unison with her quick, jerky footsteps,
and over an old-fashioned black silk
gown she wore a rich lace mantilla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s Mrs. Lennox,” said Aunt
Molly, rising. “I dare say she’s coming
to call on me. Excuse me, girlies; I must
run home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us go with you,” cried Marjorie;
“I’m sure you’ll need protection from
that warlike Amazon. I wouldn’t dare
face her alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll call you over if I feel timid,”
returned Aunt Molly, who was already
half-way down the steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sure enough, the stranger turned in at
Aunt Molly’s gate, and marched up the
walk as if she were storming a citadel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jiminy crickets!” whispered Betty,
“what can she be? She’s too distinguished
for a book-agent and too excited
for a plain every-day caller.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s Zenobia,” said Millicent, “returned
to earth in disguise. I think she’s
collecting a regiment and wants us to
join it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s Minerva in modern clothes,”
said Betty, “and she wants Aunt Molly
to take her to board.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not she,” said Hester; “she’s no
summer boarder. I think she’s a dowager
countess with several castles of her
own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time they were all watching
the old lady, who was evidently telling
Aunt Molly a fearful tale of woe, for she
gesticulated angrily; and though the girls
could not hear her words, they gazed at
her bobbing feathers and her clenched
hands in sympathy with her trouble, whatever
it might be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Aunt Molly called out:
“Come over here, girlies; I want you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over flew the Octave helter-skelter;
but they stood up politely enough while
Aunt Molly introduced them to her guest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Mrs. Lennox,” continued Aunt
Molly, “is in a sad dilemma. Only yesterday—but
I will ask her to tell you
about it herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I will tell you,” cried Mrs. Lennox,
fairly glaring at the flock of girls,
who fell in an expectant group at her
feet, “for the tale ought to be blazoned
abroad to the four winds of heaven!
Gratitude, thou’rt but an empty name!
Respect, honor, deference? Chimeras all—chimeras
all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls sat enthralled, though Millicent
with difficulty restrained herself
from replying to the old lady in kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are told,” went on Mrs. Lennox,
waving her hand dramatically, “that this
is a free country! No greater, graver
misstatement was ever made. We are
slaves!” And she shook her clenched fist
at Nan, who chanced to be nearest her,
with such a belligerent air that the poor
Poet feared she was responsible for the
national bondage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Slaves!” continued Mrs. Lennox,
warming to her subject and waving both
arms about. “Slaves to our servants!
The time has come when they rule us;
they dictate to us; they make the laws
and we obey them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m,” murmured Helen, who
thought the ensuing pause ought to be
filled somehow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now what have my servants
done?” she cried, looking from one young
face to another, but too engrossed to
notice the various expressions of mirth or
bewilderment on each.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As no one was in a position to reply,
she continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have they done? They have
left me! Departed, one and all, with no
word of warning, no cause for offense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did they go?” inquired Betty,
who liked to know reasons for things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! James, my butler, obtained a fine
position in a large hotel in the city, and,
viper that he is, he must needs tell all the
others of it, and one and all, from the head
cook down to the footman, ungratefully
left my kind service and followed James to
the unknown, untried hardships of a city
hotel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you can get a new set of servants,”
said Aunt Molly, soothingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I can,” cried Mrs. Lennox,
bristling up as if her dignity had been
menaced. “Of course I can! Hosts of
the best servants in the country are only
awaiting an opportunity to come to my
service. But it takes time to procure and
install a new lot, and here is the culmination
of my dismay. But now I received
a telegram bidding me expect Lady Pendered
and her daughter to-morrow, to remain
with me overnight. Ah, my dear
friend, you do not know Lady Pendered,
but she represents the very flower of the
British aristocracy. Her fair daughter
Lucy is a sweet gem of purest ray serene,
and they have never known what it was to
have less than twenty servants at their
finger-ends. And my James was such a
paragon of a butler! Alas, alas! how
sharper than a servant’s tooth—no, a
thankless tooth—ah, well, the quotation
has slipped my memory for the moment,
but I will recall it anon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When are your English friends coming?”
asked Aunt Molly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow afternoon,” replied Mrs.
Lennox; “and oh, how it would have
pleased me were I but able to offer them
such hospitality as ’tis in my heart to give!
They can remain with me but twenty-four
hours, and then they will speed away to
publish broadcast the news that Miranda
Lennox has no establishment save one old
colored woman and a good-for-nothing
boy. For those, alas! are all I can find in
this howling wilderness of a sea-shore
town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girls,” was all Aunt Molly said, but
she looked volumes of meaning out of her
kind, clever eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marjorie was first to understand and
respond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course we can,” she cried, “can’t
we, girls? It would be the jolliest sort of
a lark, and a ‘helping hand’ besides.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We could,” said Betty, “but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But me no buts,” cried Hester. “We
can and we will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vote!” exclaimed Marjorie. “Shall
we or sha’n’t we? All in favor, aye!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye!” yelled the eight; and so quickly
was it all done that Mrs. Lennox still
wore a look of frightened bewilderment
when Marjorie began:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Mrs. Lennox, you want accomplished
and experienced servants to
permit you to entertain your friends properly.
We claim to be such, and we offer
you our services with the greatest pleasure,
the only condition being that you
take the whole eight.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1.1em;'>WILLING SERVICE</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>T this unexpected solution of her
great problem Mrs. Lennox recovered
herself quickly, and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dears, if you only would!
But do you really mean it? Do they?”
And she looked at Aunt Molly for confirmation
of an offer too good to be true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think they do,” said Aunt Molly,
smiling; “and I can assure you, dear Mrs.
Lennox, that whatever these young ladies
undertake will be well and thoroughly
done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can we do it?” said Nan. “Do
you mean for the English ladies to think
we’re really servants?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course they must,” cried Millicent,
who had waked up to the glorious possibilities
of the situation. “Unless it’s a real
masquerade it’ll be no fun at all. But
where can we get the right kind of caps
and aprons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Molly volunteered to go to town
for them that very afternoon, and Mrs.
Lennox, seeing that these strange girls
were really in earnest, accepted the blessing
Heaven had so unexpectedly sent
her, and at once began to make the most
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which of you are the best cooks?”
she inquired, with the air of a general
marshaling his forces—but such a capable
and straightforward general that no
offense could possibly be felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hester and Marjorie,” was the immediate
reply of the other six.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” said Mrs. Lennox. “Hester
shall be head cook, since you named
her first, and Marjorie assistant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Jessie and Betty were selected
as being the deftest waitresses, and Millicent
and Helen were declared ideal lady’s-maids.
Helen preferred to be Mrs. Lennox’s
own maid, so Millicent was allotted
to the English visitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All agreed that Marguerite would make
the most picturesque parlor-maid, and as
no other post could be thought of, Nan
said she would be private secretary and
librarian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lennox entered heartily into all
the details of the scheme, and agreed
with Millicent that if the thing were done
at all, it must be done completely and
with most careful attention to minutiæ.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could you submit to be spoken to as
menials?” said Mrs. Lennox. “For I am
most anxious to impress my English
friends with the superiority of our servants
over theirs. You would have to be
modest and deferential, address me as
‘madam,’ and both the visitors as ‘your
ladyship.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all this only made it seem more of
a lark, and after copious directions Mrs.
Lennox went home, the eight girls promising
to appear the next afternoon at
two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night Aunt Molly returned from
the city, bringing wonderful paraphernalia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waitresses were to wear white—pique
skirts and linen shirt-waists; their
caps were of the conventional shape, and
their aprons were voluminous indeed, with
crossed straps and broad wings, which
Uncle Ned declared could not be surpassed
for acreage in all London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cooks were to wear white, too—linen
blouses with rolled-up sleeves, and
real cooks’ caps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady’s-maids wore pink and blue
gingham respectively, with aprons befrilled
and beflounced, and most fetching
little caps with ribbon bows.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='i245'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i245.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0011' style='width:75%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“THE GEM OF THE COLLECTION.”</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>But Marguerite was pronounced “the
gem of the collection.” In her plain
black dress, with a white apron of thin
lawn, trimmed with a wide accordion-plaited
ruffle, and tied back with a most
enormous bow, a hand in each pocket
of her apron, she looked like the coquettish
parlor-maid one sees on the stage or
in the comic papers. A bewitching little
cap was jauntily perched on her fluffy
golden hair, and her high-heeled slippers
clicked gaily as she tripped around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At two o’clock precisely, on the day of
the performance, the eight presented themselves
at Mrs. Lennox’s door and were
admitted by that lady herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you <span class='it'>are</span> a proper-looking lot,”
she exclaimed as the girls filed in, “and
you’ve taken a weight off my mind, I can
tell you. When I woke this morning I
thought it was all a dream,—your coming,
I mean,—and I have not really felt sure
of you until I saw you approaching.
Goodness gracious, Miss Marguerite, I
think her ladyship will open her eyes at
my parlor-maid! Of course I shall call
you all by your first names; they’re
rather unusual for servants, some of them,
but I’ll explain that American servants
are often elaborately dubbed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the girls flew to their respective
places, and work began in earnest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hester and Marjorie were a bit appalled
at the overflowing condition of Mrs. Lennox’s
larder; but Nan and Millicent, having
nothing to do, came to their assistance,
and a really fine dinner was soon in
course of preparation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jessie and Betty set the table, while
Marguerite gathered flowers and decorated
the various rooms until they were
fragrant bowers of beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lennox’s house was a large and
luxurious mansion, exquisitely appointed
and with beautiful furnishings. Indeed,
so delighted was Marguerite with her surroundings
and with the mirrored representations
of her pretty self that she almost
forgot to do her work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it fun?” said Jessie, as she
passed the parlor door with a huge silver-basket
which Mrs. Lennox had just intrusted
to her. “It’s a delight to set a
table with such lovely things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are the cooks?” said Marguerite,
leaving off pirouetting before the
pier-glass and coming out to chum with
the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But her entrance to the kitchen was not
welcomed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go away!” cried Marjorie. “Fly
away, you butterfly. We’re really busy,
and much flustered besides.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem to be frying everything,”
commented Marguerite, teasingly. “There
is a sound as of sizzling grease.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The crackling of grease saved Rome,”
called out Hester, and Marguerite went
back giggling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at last everything was in readiness,
and not any too soon, either; for the
door-bell rang a resounding peal. Hurriedly
the servants confabbed as to whose
place it was to go to the door. In the
absence of a man-servant they concluded
it was a waitress’s place; but Marguerite
settled the question by remarking that, no
matter whose place it was, <span class='it'>she</span> would go
anyhow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan was ensconced in the library,
Helen was with Mrs. Lennox in her boudoir,
and Millicent waiting in the guests’
apartments; but the eyes of the other
four were peering cautiously from behind
doors and portières as the pretty and
audacious parlor-maid flung open the
front door with an air that would have
done credit to a Lord Chamberlain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Lennox?” murmured the grand
lady visitor, somewhat taken aback at the
lovely vision confronting her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, your ladyships,” said Marguerite’s
pretty voice. “Will your ladyships
enter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She curtsied low, then ushered the
visitors into the drawing-room and presented
her silver tray for cards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady Pendered and Lady Lucy Pendered,”
said the elder guest, in dignified
tones; and Marguerite reddened and
whipped her tray behind her, wondering
if she had made a mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thought she caught the echo of a
giggling retreat to the kitchen, but, determined
to play her part as well as she
could, she tripped upstairs and announced
the guests to Mrs. Lennox.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go down at once,” said that
lady. “Helen, my shawl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, madam,” said Helen, gracefully
offering the dainty trifle of a shawl; and
then Mrs. Lennox sailed downstairs, and
the two girls dropped to the floor and
rocked back and forth in silent paroxysms
of mirth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a bell summoned Helen and Millicent,
and, resolutely assuming a prim demeanor,
they went downstairs side by side
and presented themselves for orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although a woman of age and experience,
Lady Pendered had never seen just
such lady’s-maids as these before, and
she raised her lorgnon and stared at them
with perhaps pardonable curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Millicent, attend these ladies,” said
Mrs. Lennox, easily. “I trust she will
make you comfortable, Lady Pendered.
Helen is my own maid, but I beg you will
command her, Lady Lucy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Lucy Pendered was a pale, willowy
girl of perhaps eighteen or twenty,
with light-blue eyes and straw-colored
hair which was most exceedingly frizzed.
Millicent and Helen promptly disliked
her; but with demure deference they relieved
the distinguished visitors of their
wraps and hand-bags and preceded them
upstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arriving at their rooms, Lady Pendered
dismissed Helen, declaring that Mrs. Lennox
must need her, and stating that she
and her daughter could easily manage
with one maid. Which Millicent discovered
to mean that Lady Lucy would monopolize
her services, and Lady Pendered
would shift for herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a beginning, Lady Lucy reclined
languidly on a couch and thrust out her
foot, which was heavily shod, after the
most exaggerated English fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Millicent felt annoyed,
and her face flushed deep red; then, remembering
it was a game, she threw herself
into it in her own whole-souled way,
and, dropping on her knees before the pale-haired
aristocrat, she removed her heavy
boots, brought her slippers and put them
on for her, and then proceeded to assist
her through the intricacies of a very
elaborate toilet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Millicent afterward confessed to Marjorie
that she <span class='it'>did</span> want to burn the Lady
Lucy’s noble forehead when she frizzed
that ridiculous nest on top of her head;
but at the time she was a most exemplary
lady’s-maid, deft, patient, and willing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Helen was assisting Mrs.
Lennox to don her grandest attire in
honor of her titled guests, and not having
to masquerade just then, Helen and the
eccentric old lady were becoming fast
friends.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span><h1>CHAPTER XV</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1.1em;'>HILARIOUS HOSPITALITY</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE dinner-table was a surprise even
to Mrs. Lennox. Although her own
table appointments were fastidiously correct,
they had been supplemented by
Jessie’s exquisite arrangement of flowers,
and by dainty dinner-cards which Millicent
had that morning painted in water-color.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two “white-winged angels,” as the
immaculate waitresses called each other,
stood like marble statues while the guests
entered the dining-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This brought Lady Pendered’s lorgnon
again into requisition, and she scanned
Betty and Jessie until, as they afterward
declared, they felt like waxworks at the
Eden Musée.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the fun began. The two waitresses,
intent on doing their best, were so
careful and thoughtful that Mrs. Lennox
grew more and more dignified and important,
as befitted the mistress of such a
fine establishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hester and Marjorie sent in most deliciously
cooked dishes, which were faultlessly
served by the expert waitresses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Pendered expatiated on the extreme
delicacy of her daughter’s constitution,
and averred that the Lady Lucy
had absolutely no appetite and ate literally
nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This moved the apparently oblivious
Betty to offer Lady Lucy braised sweet-breads
for the second time, and as the
fragile one helped herself bountifully,
Jessie again urged upon her the stuffed
cucumbers, of which she again partook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child, my child, you will be ill,”
said Lady Pendered, in real and well-founded
alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care if I am, mamma,” said the
wilful Lady Lucy. “These American
things are very good. Why don’t we
have them at home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tut, tut, my daughter; all the world
knows nothing can excel England’s well-spread
boards. This America of yours,”
she continued, turning to Mrs. Lennox,
“is a most extraordinary place. I’ve
been here but a fortnight, and that I
spent in New York. Very awful town,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think so?” said Mrs. Lennox,
politely non-committal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, yes. It’s so sudden and
unexpected. One never knows what will
happen next.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m rather fond of New York,” said
Mrs. Lennox; “but of course its homes
are different from English country
houses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, quite different; and the service
is something atrocious. My dear Miranda,
you are to be congratulated on
your establishment. I haven’t seen a
decent lady’s-maid since I left England
until I reached here. That pretty Millicent
of yours is a treasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although inwardly convulsed, Betty
managed to control her features, and by
biting her lips achieved an expression of
intense agony, which was, however, better
than laughing aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not so Jessie. The sudden mental
picture of Millicent assisting these ladies
at their toilet was too much for her, and
with a smothered sound, something between
a chuckle and a scream, she hurriedly
retreated to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” cried Hester and Marjorie,
seeing the waitress appear unexpectedly
and almost in hysterics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jessie had a plucky determination
of her own, and, without a word to the
bewildered cooks, she pulled herself together,
straightened her face to an expression
of demure propriety, and was
back in the dining-room with her tray in
less than two minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the ordeal was not yet over. When
she returned, Lady Pendered was still
recounting Millicent’s virtues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, really,” said the English lady,
“she crimped my fringe quite as well as
Parkins does at home. And my clothes
were never brushed more neatly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Millicent brushing clothes! This was
almost too much for Betty; but, not daring
to glance at Jessie, she went on about her
work, endeavoring not to listen to any
further disclosures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she’s not bad,” drawled Lady
Lucy; “she darned a bit of a rent in my
lace bodice, and smiled amiably when I
asked her to do up my fine handkerchiefs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Millicent as a laundress! The girls
nearly broke down at this. But Mrs.
Lennox’s clear, even voice speaking restored
their calm. Surely if she could
preserve her equanimity they ought to
do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Millicent is indeed a perfect servant,”
the hostess was saying; “but all of my
maids are. I could not wish for a better
lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Mrs. Lennox,” said the languid
Lucy, “they do seem superior—all except
that frivolous parlor-maid of yours.
We wouldn’t like to have such a pretty
one at home. But then, I have brothers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A heavy portière at the end of the dining-room
waved convulsively at this, and
the too pretty parlor-maid scurried away
to a distant room where she could enjoy
the joke with some of her fellow-servants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now one of Hester’s greatest feats
was the concoction of Yorkshire pudding.
It was the real thing, and was a favorite
dish at the club table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this occasion, therefore, she fairly
outdid herself, and when it accompanied
a very English-looking joint to the table,
Lady Pendered’s delight knew no bounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yorkshire pudding!” she exclaimed.
“Ah, Miranda, you have an English cook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Mrs. Lennox was but very slightly
acquainted with her cooks, she felt a trifle
uncertain as to their nationality. But
she was not easily disconcerted, and,
turning to Jessie, she said indifferently:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My head cook <span class='it'>is</span> English, is she
not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, madam,” replied Jessie; “Hester
is English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And my assistant cook, what is her
name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the sound of her own voice had
been too much for Jessie, and her wits
deserted her entirely. In a half-dazed
way she realized that Mrs. Lennox was
asking her to name Marjorie, and, quite
without her own volition, she replied
mechanically:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Duchess, madam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” cried Lady Pendered, raising
her eye-glass to look at the luckless
Jessie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Betty came quickly to the rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Dutch, madam,” she said, addressing
Mrs. Lennox; “the cook’s
assistant is Dutch, and her name is
Marjorie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is,” said Mrs. Lennox, calmly.
“I remember now. But really, dear Lady
Pendered, in America one troubles one’s
self so little with these matters. I rarely
see my kitchen servants, and almost never
have occasion to call them by name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonderful system!” said Lady Pendered,
appalled at this state of culinary
perfection. “As a mere gratification of
my curiosity, may I see your English
cook? I would be glad to interview one
who can make such a pudding as this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” said Mrs. Lennox, though
not without some misgivings. “Jessie,
summon Hester to the dining-room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, madam,” said Jessie, and she
flew into the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Hester, Lady Pendered wants to
interview you; you’re to come in at once.
And she’ll nearly kill you—she’s so
funny, I mean; but do be careful, Hester,
and don’t laugh or anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trust me,” said Hester, smoothing
out her apron and straightening her cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I sent for?” asked Marjorie. “I
don’t care; I’m going anyway. I won’t
be kept out of the fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jessie returned to the dining-room, followed
by Hester. After hesitating a
moment, Marjorie followed, and stood
modestly behind her chief. These tidy
and well-favored cooks seemed to rouse
Lady Pendered’s ire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well!” she exclaimed. “I never
saw anything like it. Are you an English
girl? Where are you from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Igham Ferrers, your ladyship,” said
Hester, dropping a very British curtsy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long have you been in America?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A matter of a year, your ladyship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With whom did you live in Higham
Ferrers, that you learned to cook so well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With the Laveracks, your ladyship;
a grand family, and most hexacting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With another curtsy, Hester was gone,
and Marjorie, too, for with Jessie and
Betty looking at them they felt sure they
couldn’t keep from laughing another
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s most extraordinary,” said Lady
Pendered; “not only that you should
have such capable and well-trained servants,
but that they should all be such
pretty and neat young girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust my servants are always tidy,”
said Mrs. Lennox, with great dignity; and
then she resolutely changed the subject, and
forced the conversation into other channels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner the ladies went for a stroll
on the beach, Millicent and Helen accompanying
them, carrying veils, wraps,
purses, and other impedimenta.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of the club-members were
much annoyed that the two girls had to
go, for they had planned to have a hilarious
dinner of their own after the more
formal meal was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the two lady’s-maids declared they
wanted to go, saying it was great fun to
attend on the high-bred foreigners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the fun was greatly increased
when, on reaching the pavilion, they met
Uncle Ned and Aunt Molly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lennox greeted these delightful
people, and presented them to her guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady’s-maids sat, demurely unobtrusive,
a little apart from the group, but
not out of range of Uncle Ned’s merry
eyes, which twinkled and winked at them
whenever opportunity offered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those are uncommonly pretty attendants
you have, Mrs. Lennox,” said Uncle
Ned, in a stage-whisper; but Aunt Molly
pulled his coat-tail furtively, and said,
“How blue the sea is to-night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime Mrs. Lennox’s usually quiet
and dignified home was the scene of wonderful
hilarity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jessie and Betty were recounting all
the details of the dinner at which they
had served so successfully. Marguerite
confessed that she and Nan had basely
spied from behind the portières. Hester
and Marjorie owned up that their iced
pudding had failed to freeze properly, and
they had had to send Helen to the confectioner’s
for ices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all agreed that Mrs. Lennox was a
dear, and that they were glad of the opportunity
to help her in her time of need.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not realizing how fast time was flying,
they gathered in the music-room, and
Marguerite played on Mrs. Lennox’s
grand piano, while all sang their favorite
songs lustily and with a will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” cried Marguerite, “in honor
of our distinguished English guests and
our far more distinguished English cook,
we will sing ‘Rule Britannia!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At it they went pell-mell, and as the
chorus rose high and strong the beach-party
returned, and entered the front door
to be greeted by the assurance that
Britons never, never, never should be
slaves!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVI</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1.1em;'>A WELCOME INVITATION</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>ITH great presence of mind Hester
suddenly turned out the lights in
the music-room, and under cover of the
darkness the girls scurried away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lennox, grasping the situation,
led her guests to the parlor, remarking:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I allow my maids the use of the piano
once a week. One can’t be <span class='it'>too</span> strict with
them, and besides it keeps the instrument
in better condition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Pendered sniffed a little at this,
and opined that the American customs
were beyond her ken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the services of the lady’s-maids were
required late at night, it had been arranged
that Millicent and Helen should
sleep at Mrs. Lennox’s; but the other six
returned to Hilarity Hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Ned and Aunt Molly called for
them at the kitchen door, and it was with
difficulty they repressed their merriment
until they were far enough down the
street to be out of ear-shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then all the girls talked at once, and
as they had most appreciative listeners,
the fun waxed high.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning, bright and early, they
returned to the scene of their labors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite, armed with a huge and
fluffy feather duster, posed anew before
the pier-glasses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen seated herself at a desk in the
library, and though looking like the primmest
and most industrious of amanuenses,
was in reality writing a letter to her mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the cooks and waitresses went to
work, and exerted themselves to the utmost
to show those “English sillies,” as
Marjorie called them, what an American
breakfast in its perfection is like.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She wants her hair frizzed again!”
said Millicent, in tones of deepest disgust,
as she came into the kitchen to fill an
alcohol-lamp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s lucky they selected you,
Lamplighter, for that position; <span class='it'>I</span> couldn’t
have filled it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; you couldn’t even have filled
the lamp,” said Millicent, as she hurried
to her uncongenial work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The breakfast was ideal—beautifully
cooked, perfectly served, and appreciatively
eaten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When it was over, Hester sat for a few
moments on the vine-clad piazza that ran
across the back of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To her came Lady Pendered, stepping
softly and looking cautiously about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re the cook, Hester, are you
not?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, your ladyship,” answered Hester,
and not over-graciously, for she
didn’t like her countrywoman at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hester, I want you to go back to
England and live with me. I’m sure
you’d like your own home better than
this savage country, and I’ll give you a
pound a week and found.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Lady Pendered began her
speech Hester felt angry; but as she continued,
the funny side of it struck the
pseudo-cook, and she answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi couldn’t do it nohow, your ladyship.
Hi ’ave a good ’ome ’ere, and
Hi likes my missus, and Hi’d not be by
way of livin’ with the haristocracy hanyway—but
meanin’ no hoffense to your
ladyship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After further useless attempts to persuade
the superior cook to go home with
her, Lady Pendered walked off in high
dudgeon, and Hester flew back into the
kitchen to tell Marjorie about it, which
was not altogether necessary, as that
young woman had gleefully viewed the
scene through a latticed window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime Lady Lucy, in her boudoir,
was trying to persuade Millicent to enter
her service, and that romantic purveyor
of fairy-tales was astonishing the English
girl, to her own mischievous delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d be glad to go with your ladyship,”
she was saying. “I’m sure there couldn’t
be a lovelier lady to work for in all England
or Arabia. Your hair is just beautiful,
miss—my lady, I mean. And of
course my mistress could easily fill my
place here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then come with me,” said Lady Lucy,
eagerly. “I’ll be very good to you; you
shall have every other Sunday afternoon
out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my lady, you’re too generous!
But it’s no use tempting me thus. I
cannot go. I fear to cross the wild and
wavy ocean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense!” cried Lady Lucy. “Is
that all? Why, there’s not a bit of
danger. We’ll go on the safest ship
afloat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t that, my lady; I fear not
shipwrecks, but <span class='it'>sharks</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Millicent put on her deep tragic
tones and gazed intently at her hearer,
she was very impressive; and the Lady
Lucy began to feel a trifle scared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sharks! What trash!” she said; but
she was fascinated by Millicent’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, my lady; ’tis true. A strange
fatality follows all my family. My great-uncle
fell overboard and was eaten by a
shark; my second cousin was caught by
a shark while swimming; and my aunt’s
grandmother”—here her voice fell to a
thrilling whisper—“went out for a walk
in her garden, and a shark came right up
out of the brook and bit off her left foot.
Oh, no, my lady; never would I dare the
terrors of the briny deep. ’Tis a curse—a
fatal curse!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time Millicent was stalking up
and down the room, waving her arms
about tragically and groaning deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, my lady, tempt me not to a dire
fate! Urge me not on an errand which
would but lead me to my fearful doom!
Fain would I serve so fair a mistress; but,
alas! it is not mine to choose my lot. I
am forever beneath a ban—a ban—a
ban!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point Mrs. Lennox entered, and
Millicent at once assumed her ordinary
manner, though Lady Lucy was quite
unstrung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This could not be explained, as she had
no intention of telling her hostess how
she had tried to lure away one of her
servants, and so Mrs. Lennox came to the
conclusion that her old friend’s daughter
was a very hysterical, weak-minded young
woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning wore away, and soon
after luncheon the visitors prepared to
depart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pretty Marguerite was a little too
much in evidence for a parlor-maid;
but she was so anxious to see as much
as possible of the interesting English
ladies that she couldn’t keep properly
in the background. Her reward was a
withering glance from Lady Pendered
as she drove away, and an overheard
remark that “Miranda’s servants were
all admirable except that yellow-haired
popinjay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when the carriage containing the
Ladies Pendered was entirely out of
sight Mrs. Lennox’s manner underwent
a decided change, and the girls realized
for the first time how much she, too, had
been masquerading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re perfect dears!” she cried.
“Let me kiss you—the whole lot of you!
It was the most wonderful success! And
I rather think I impressed Mary Pendered
with our American superiority in
some ways at least. Girls, I shall never
forget your kindness. You were trumps—absolute
trumps. Now listen to me,
my dearies. I have to go to the city to-morrow
to get a new staff of servants,
though I can assure you they’ll never
give me such fine work as you girls have
done. But that was fairyland, and we
must now drop back to a prosaic reality
in the matter of housekeeping. Now this
is what I want you to do. Go back to
your cottage for a couple of days, and
then shut it up and come to stay with me
as my guests for the rest of the time you
are at Long Beach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mrs. Lennox,” cried Marguerite,
“how lovely that would be! The housekeeping
at the cottage was fun in some
ways; but I’d far rather stay in this
lovely home, and <span class='it'>not</span> cook my own meals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lazy Daisy!” said Marjorie. “But I
own up that I, too, am a little tired of the
working part of Hilarity Hall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And well you may be,” chimed in
Betty, “for you did far more than your
share of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I didn’t,” declared Marjorie.
“But as president of the Cooking Club I
move we accept Mrs. Lennox’s invitation
with heartfelt gratitude, and that a copy of
these resolutions be engrossed and framed
and presented to the lady in question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, aye!” cried seven voices; and
Mrs. Lennox beamed with delight at the
anticipation of the frolics of these young
girls in her somewhat lonely house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the good lady went to New York,
and the girls trooped back to Hilarity
Hall and told Aunt Molly all about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems a bit like defeat,” said Hester,
who always liked to carry out successfully
anything she undertook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” said Aunt Molly. “You
have no especial reason for staying in the
cottage if a pleasanter plan offers itself.
Take the goods the gods provide, and be
thankful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I do hate to cook,” confessed
Marguerite. “It’s all very well for Hester
and Marjorie. They can put a bone
in a kettle of water, set it on the fire,
and wag a bay-leaf at it, and behold a
delicious soup! But I follow carefully
that grimy old cookery-book, get out
all the utensils in the cupboard, and
stew myself into a salamander, and then
I’ve only an uneatable mess as the result.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, my pretty parlor-maid,”
said Marjorie; “some are born cooks—that’s
me; some achieve cooks—that’s
Mrs. Lennox; and some have cooking
thrust upon them—and that’s what we’ll
do after to-morrow. Now let’s write up
the annals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’ll write up the annals of our
sojourn at Mrs. Lennox’s?” said Betty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Past or future?” queried Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, past! We’ll all do the future
ones when we get there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s leave the annals of the Pendered
party to do after we get there, too,”
proposed Millicent; “we’ll have more time
and can do them better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All agreed to this; so Hester took the
“Whitecap” and said she’d wind up
the cottage annals in short order; which
she did, with this result:</p>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
